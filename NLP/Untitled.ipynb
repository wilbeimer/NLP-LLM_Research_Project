      "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and\n",
      "happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\n",
      "existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\n",
      "little to distress or vex her.\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\n",
      "indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage,\n",
      "been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had\n",
      "died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\n",
      "of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\n",
      "as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a\n",
      "governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\n",
      "of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even\n",
      "before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\n",
      "the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\n",
      "restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\n",
      "had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\n",
      "and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s\n",
      "judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.\n",
      "The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having\n",
      "rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\n",
      "well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\n",
      "her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so\n",
      "unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\n",
      "her.\n",
      "Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any\n",
      "disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor’s\n",
      "loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\n",
      "beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\n",
      "continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\n",
      "and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\n",
      "cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after\n",
      "dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\n",
      "had lost.\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was\n",
      "a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\n",
      "pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\n",
      "what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\n",
      "promoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. The want\n",
      "of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\n",
      "past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had\n",
      "taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had\n",
      "devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed\n",
      "her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\n",
      "gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\n",
      "the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\n",
      "Isabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\n",
      "dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\n",
      "as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\n",
      "all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\n",
      "peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\n",
      "hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\n",
      "such an affection for her as could never find fault.\n",
      "How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going\n",
      "only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\n",
      "difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\n",
      "Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\n",
      "domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\n",
      "solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\n",
      "He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\n",
      "The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\n",
      "not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\n",
      "for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\n",
      "or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\n",
      "everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\n",
      "temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\n",
      "Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\n",
      "settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\n",
      "reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\n",
      "through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\n",
      "Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\n",
      "and give her pleasant society again.\n",
      "Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\n",
      "to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\n",
      "name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\n",
      "first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\n",
      "acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\n",
      "not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\n",
      "even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\n",
      "sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\n",
      "and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\n",
      "was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\n",
      "used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\n",
      "Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\n",
      "by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could\n",
      "ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\n",
      "match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\n",
      "too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\n",
      "to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\n",
      "was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\n",
      "herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\n",
      "had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\n",
      "chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\n",
      "when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\n",
      "said at dinner,\n",
      "“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\n",
      "Mr. Weston ever thought of her!”\n",
      "“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\n",
      "good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a\n",
      "good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\n",
      "ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\n",
      "own?”\n",
      "“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\n",
      "This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my\n",
      "dear.”\n",
      "“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We\n",
      "shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\n",
      "visit very soon.”\n",
      "“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\n",
      "not walk half so far.”\n",
      "“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\n",
      "to be sure.”\n",
      "“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\n",
      "little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\n",
      "visit?”\n",
      "“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have\n",
      "settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\n",
      "night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\n",
      "to Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only\n",
      "doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\n",
      "papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\n",
      "mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!”\n",
      "“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\n",
      "have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\n",
      "sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\n",
      "girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\n",
      "curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\n",
      "have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\n",
      "of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\n",
      "excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\n",
      "to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\n",
      "over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\n",
      "be able to tell her how we all are.”\n",
      "Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\n",
      "hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\n",
      "the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\n",
      "backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\n",
      "walked in and made it unnecessary.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\n",
      "only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\n",
      "connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived\n",
      "about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\n",
      "and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\n",
      "mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\n",
      "some days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\n",
      "well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\n",
      "always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and\n",
      "her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\n",
      "have had a shocking walk.”\n",
      "“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\n",
      "must draw back from your great fire.”\n",
      "“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\n",
      "catch cold.”\n",
      "“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”\n",
      "“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\n",
      "here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\n",
      "breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”\n",
      "“By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\n",
      "sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\n",
      "congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\n",
      "all behave? Who cried most?”\n",
      "“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.”\n",
      "“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n",
      "‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\n",
      "comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it\n",
      "must be better to have only one to please than two.”\n",
      "“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\n",
      "creature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I\n",
      "know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”\n",
      "“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with\n",
      "a sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”\n",
      "“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\n",
      "Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\n",
      "myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a\n",
      "joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\n",
      "in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\n",
      "though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\n",
      "would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\n",
      "really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\n",
      "every body.\n",
      "“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no\n",
      "reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\n",
      "to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\n",
      "a gainer.”\n",
      "“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about the\n",
      "wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\n",
      "charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\n",
      "not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\n",
      "we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\n",
      "every day.”\n",
      "“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\n",
      "sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”\n",
      "Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It is\n",
      "impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\n",
      "Knightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\n",
      "suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s\n",
      "advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s\n",
      "time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\n",
      "her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\n",
      "herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\n",
      "must be glad to have her so happily married.”\n",
      "“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a\n",
      "very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match,\n",
      "you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\n",
      "the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\n",
      "may comfort me for any thing.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah! my\n",
      "dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\n",
      "whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\n",
      "matches.”\n",
      "“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\n",
      "other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\n",
      "success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\n",
      "again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\n",
      "seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\n",
      "either in his business in town or among his friends here, always\n",
      "acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend\n",
      "a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\n",
      "Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\n",
      "promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\n",
      "uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\n",
      "subject, but I believed none of it.\n",
      "“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met\n",
      "with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\n",
      "away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\n",
      "Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\n",
      "match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\n",
      "instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\n",
      "match-making.”\n",
      "“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\n",
      "spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\n",
      "about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But\n",
      "if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\n",
      "means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I\n",
      "think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\n",
      "to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then\n",
      "afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\n",
      "you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\n",
      "said.”\n",
      "“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I\n",
      "pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\n",
      "never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\n",
      "word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\n",
      "entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\n",
      "but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and\n",
      "the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given\n",
      "many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\n",
      "not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\n",
      "enough to comprehend that.”\n",
      "“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\n",
      "unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\n",
      "own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\n",
      "good to them, by interference.”\n",
      "“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not\n",
      "make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family\n",
      "circle grievously.”\n",
      "“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\n",
      "Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\n",
      "Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has\n",
      "fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\n",
      "him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands\n",
      "to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\n",
      "kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\n",
      "the only way I have of doing him a service.”\n",
      "“Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good\n",
      "young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew\n",
      "him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.\n",
      "That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so\n",
      "kind as to meet him.”\n",
      "“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "laughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\n",
      "thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\n",
      "and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\n",
      "man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”\n",
      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\n",
      "which for the last two or three generations had been rising into\n",
      "gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\n",
      "succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\n",
      "for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\n",
      "and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by\n",
      "entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\n",
      "Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\n",
      "military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great\n",
      "Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\n",
      "surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\n",
      "who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would\n",
      "offend.\n",
      "Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\n",
      "fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was\n",
      "not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\n",
      "infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off\n",
      "with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce\n",
      "much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had\n",
      "a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing\n",
      "due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\n",
      "but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\n",
      "resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but\n",
      "not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s\n",
      "unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\n",
      "They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\n",
      "of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\n",
      "once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\n",
      "Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\n",
      "as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\n",
      "the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he\n",
      "was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\n",
      "From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\n",
      "had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\n",
      "mother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\n",
      "creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\n",
      "of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some\n",
      "reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\n",
      "were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\n",
      "care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\n",
      "to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\n",
      "A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\n",
      "engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\n",
      "London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\n",
      "brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\n",
      "where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\n",
      "occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\n",
      "years of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\n",
      "realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little\n",
      "estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to\n",
      "marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according\n",
      "to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.\n",
      "It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\n",
      "schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\n",
      "had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\n",
      "purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\n",
      "but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\n",
      "accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\n",
      "his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\n",
      "probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\n",
      "never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\n",
      "even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\n",
      "a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\n",
      "pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\n",
      "chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\n",
      "He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\n",
      "for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\n",
      "uncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\n",
      "the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,\n",
      "therefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance. His father\n",
      "had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and\n",
      "governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston’s nature to\n",
      "imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,\n",
      "and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in\n",
      "London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\n",
      "young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\n",
      "looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\n",
      "prospects a kind of common concern.\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\n",
      "curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\n",
      "returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\n",
      "his father had been often talked of but never achieved.\n",
      "Now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\n",
      "most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not\n",
      "a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea\n",
      "with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the\n",
      "visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and\n",
      "the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his\n",
      "new mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in\n",
      "Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had\n",
      "received. “I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very\n",
      "handsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw\n",
      "the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his\n",
      "life.”\n",
      "It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\n",
      "formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\n",
      "attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\n",
      "welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\n",
      "which her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\n",
      "fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\n",
      "she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\n",
      "separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\n",
      "who could ill bear to part with her.\n",
      "She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\n",
      "pain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,\n",
      "from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\n",
      "character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\n",
      "have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\n",
      "would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\n",
      "privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance\n",
      "of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female\n",
      "walking, and in Mr. Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which would\n",
      "make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the\n",
      "evenings in the week together.\n",
      "Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more\n",
      "than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\n",
      "that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\n",
      "at his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her\n",
      "at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\n",
      "in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\n",
      "own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,\n",
      "and saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”\n",
      "There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to\n",
      "pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\n",
      "The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\n",
      "being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\n",
      "had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could\n",
      "bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\n",
      "different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\n",
      "unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\n",
      "them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\n",
      "earnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it. He had been at the\n",
      "pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\n",
      "Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were\n",
      "one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to,\n",
      "he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\n",
      "of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\n",
      "many—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\n",
      "opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\n",
      "every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\n",
      "and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\n",
      "There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\n",
      "seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse would never believe it.\n",
      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\n",
      "have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\n",
      "his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\n",
      "his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own\n",
      "little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\n",
      "intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\n",
      "hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance\n",
      "but such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,\n",
      "Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in\n",
      "the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many\n",
      "such. Not unfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of the\n",
      "chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he\n",
      "preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to\n",
      "company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could\n",
      "not make up a card-table for him.\n",
      "Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and\n",
      "by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\n",
      "of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\n",
      "elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles\n",
      "of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\n",
      "After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\n",
      "Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\n",
      "the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\n",
      "carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\n",
      "either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\n",
      "would have been a grievance.\n",
      "Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\n",
      "lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\n",
      "single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\n",
      "regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\n",
      "circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\n",
      "of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\n",
      "Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\n",
      "much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\n",
      "make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\n",
      "outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\n",
      "youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\n",
      "devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\n",
      "small income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\n",
      "a woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\n",
      "good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\n",
      "every body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to\n",
      "every body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\n",
      "surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\n",
      "neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\n",
      "simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\n",
      "spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\n",
      "herself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\n",
      "suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\n",
      "gossip.\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or an\n",
      "establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\n",
      "refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\n",
      "morality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies\n",
      "for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a\n",
      "real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\n",
      "quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\n",
      "girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\n",
      "a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highbury\n",
      "was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and\n",
      "garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\n",
      "a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\n",
      "her own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\n",
      "walked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\n",
      "who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\n",
      "the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\n",
      "neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\n",
      "or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\n",
      "These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\n",
      "collect; and happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power;\n",
      "though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the\n",
      "absence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look\n",
      "comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things\n",
      "so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that\n",
      "every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had\n",
      "fearfully anticipated.\n",
      "As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\n",
      "present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\n",
      "respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\n",
      "welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\n",
      "very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her\n",
      "beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\n",
      "longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\n",
      "Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\n",
      "her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had\n",
      "lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\n",
      "parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\n",
      "She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\n",
      "was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\n",
      "ladies who had been at school there with her.\n",
      "She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\n",
      "which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\n",
      "fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\n",
      "great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much\n",
      "pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\n",
      "continue the acquaintance.\n",
      "She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith’s\n",
      "conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not\n",
      "inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing,\n",
      "shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\n",
      "grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\n",
      "the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\n",
      "been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\n",
      "Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\n",
      "natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\n",
      "Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\n",
      "were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\n",
      "very good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\n",
      "the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a\n",
      "large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very\n",
      "creditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\n",

      "elegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve\n",
      "her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\n",
      "into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It\n",
      "would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly\n",
      "becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\n",
      "She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\n",
      "listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\n",
      "evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\n",
      "always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\n",
      "watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to\n",
      "the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common\n",
      "impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of\n",
      "doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\n",
      "mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of\n",

      "oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the\n",
      "early hours and civil scruples of their guests.\n",
      "Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare.\n",
      "He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\n",
      "youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\n",
      "rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality\n",
      "would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their\n",
      "health made him grieve that they would eat.\n",
      "Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he\n",
      "could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might\n",
      "constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer\n",
      "things, to say:\n",
      "“Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\n",
      "boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\n",
      "better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\n",
      "else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of\n",
      "our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\n",
      "_little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\n",

      "_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it\n",
      "could disagree with you.”\n",
      "Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much\n",
      "more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\n",
      "pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\n",
      "quite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\n",
      "in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\n",
      "panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\n",
      "highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which\n",

      "hands with her at last!\n",
      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "Harriet Smith’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\n",
      "and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\n",
      "and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance\n",
      "increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking\n",
      "companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\n",
      "In that respect Mrs. Weston’s loss had been important. Her father never\n",
      "went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\n",
      "him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\n",
      "Weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\n",
      "ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\n",
      "Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\n",
      "would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\n",
      "as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\n",
      "kind designs.\n",
      "Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\n",
      "disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\n",
      "guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\n",
      "very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\n",
      "appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\n",
      "of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\n",
      "Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith’s being exactly the\n",
      "young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required.\n",
      "Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\n",
      "never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\n",
      "sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\n",
      "Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.\n",
      "Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\n",
      "Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\n",
      "were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\n",
      "every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\n",
      "was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in\n",
      "the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\n",
      "had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just\n",
      "what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\n",
      "school in general, formed naturally a great part of the\n",
      "conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\n",
      "Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\n",
      "her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with\n",
      "them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\n",
      "the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\n",
      "talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and\n",
      "enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\n",
      "exultation of Mrs. Martin’s having “_two_ parlours, two very good\n",
      "parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard’s\n",
      "drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\n",
      "five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\n",
      "them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\n",
      "cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin’s saying as she was so fond of it, it\n",
      "should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\n",
      "summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\n",
      "drink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\n",
      "people.”\n",
      "For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\n",
      "cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\n",
      "arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\n",
      "daughter, a son and son’s wife, who all lived together; but when it\n",
      "appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\n",
      "always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\n",
      "something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\n",
      "Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\n",
      "friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were\n",
      "not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\n",
      "With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\n",
      "meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\n",
      "and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\n",
      "speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\n",
      "evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\n",
      "good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\n",
      "order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was\n",
      "of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\n",
      "shepherd’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\n",
      "She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\n",
      "believed he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\n",
      "fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\n",
      "wool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\n",
      "of him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had\n",
      "told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\n",
      "impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\n",
      "whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she\n",
      "_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.\n",
      "“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you are about.”\n",
      "“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\n",
      "seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\n",
      "teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\n",
      "his own business? He does not read?”\n",
      "“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good\n",
      "deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\n",
      "Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\n",
      "window seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\n",
      "evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\n",
      "the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\n",
      "Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\n",
      "Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\n",
      "mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\n",
      "can.”\n",
      "The next question was—\n",
      "“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”\n",
      "“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\n",
      "first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\n",
      "after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\n",
      "and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\n",
      "Kingston. He has passed you very often.”\n",
      "“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\n",
      "any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\n",
      "is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\n",
      "precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\n",
      "do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\n",
      "me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\n",
      "But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\n",
      "as much above my notice as in every other he is below it.”\n",
      "“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed\n",
      "him; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”\n",
      "“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\n",
      "indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\n",
      "his age to be?”\n",
      "“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n",
      "23rd just a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.”\n",
      "“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\n",
      "perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\n",
      "they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\n",
      "probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\n",
      "of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\n",
      "might be very desirable.”\n",
      "“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”\n",
      "“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\n",
      "not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\n",
      "entirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\n",
      "money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\n",
      "the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\n",
      "stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\n",
      "be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\n",
      "any thing yet.”\n",
      "“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\n",
      "indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\n",
      "of taking a boy another year.”\n",
      "“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\n",
      "marry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his\n",
      "sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\n",
      "to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\n",
      "to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\n",
      "careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\n",
      "gentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\n",
      "by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people\n",
      "who would take pleasure in degrading you.”\n",
      "“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\n",
      "and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\n",
      "body can do.”\n",
      "“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\n",
      "would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\n",
      "independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you\n",
      "permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to\n",
      "have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if\n",
      "you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you\n",
      "may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted\n",
      "with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter,\n",
      "without education.”\n",
      "“To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\n",
      "but what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However,\n",
      "I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall\n",
      "not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\n",
      "regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\n",
      "sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\n",
      "if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\n",
      "visit her, if I can help it.”\n",
      "Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\n",
      "alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,\n",
      "but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no\n",
      "serious difficulty, on Harriet’s side, to oppose any friendly\n",
      "arrangement of her own.\n",
      "They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\n",
      "Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\n",
      "her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\n",
      "not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\n",
      "yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\n",
      "sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\n",
      "neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\n",
      "other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\n",
      "thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet’s\n",
      "inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\n",
      "noticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\n",
      "Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\n",
      "They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\n",
      "kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\n",
      "and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\n",
      "compose.\n",
      "“Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a\n",
      "chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\n",
      "think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\n",
      "most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\n",
      "He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot\n",
      "it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!\n",
      "Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think\n",
      "of him? Do you think him so very plain?”\n",
      "“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing\n",
      "compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\n",
      "much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\n",
      "very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\n",
      "degree or two nearer gentility.”\n",
      "“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel\n",
      "as real gentlemen.”\n",
      "“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\n",
      "repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\n",
      "must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\n",
      "Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\n",
      "men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\n",
      "company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\n",
      "inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\n",
      "thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\n",
      "Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\n",
      "look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\n",
      "be wholly unmodulated as I stood here.”\n",
      "“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air\n",
      "and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.\n",
      "But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!”\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\n",
      "compare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\n",
      "_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\n",
      "only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\n",
      "and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\n",
      "manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being\n",
      "silent. You must see the difference.”\n",
      "“Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\n",
      "man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”\n",
      "“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\n",
      "grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\n",
      "be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\n",
      "awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\n",
      "age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\n",
      "Weston’s time of life?”\n",
      "“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.\n",
      "“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\n",
      "vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\n",
      "nothing but profit and loss.”\n",
      "“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”\n",
      "“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\n",
      "circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\n",
      "He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\n",
      "else—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\n",
      "do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\n",
      "rich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\n",
      "_us_.”\n",
      "“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all Harriet’s answer, and\n",
      "spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\n",
      "safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\n",
      "next beginning was,\n",
      "“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton’s manners are superior to Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s or Mr. Weston’s. They have more gentleness. They might be\n",
      "more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\n",
      "almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\n",
      "because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to\n",
      "be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley’s downright, decided, commanding\n",
      "sort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\n",
      "and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to\n",
      "set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I\n",
      "think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as\n",
      "a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He\n",
      "seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\n",
      "whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\n",
      "Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\n",
      "softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to\n",
      "please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”\n",
      "She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from\n",
      "Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,\n",
      "and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\n",
      "Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\n",
      "farmer out of Harriet’s head. She thought it would be an excellent\n",
      "match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\n",
      "to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\n",
      "else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\n",
      "body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\n",
      "entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet’s coming to\n",
      "Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of\n",
      "its expediency. Mr. Elton’s situation was most suitable, quite the\n",
      "gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\n",
      "any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\n",
      "He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\n",
      "income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\n",
      "to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\n",
      "as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\n",
      "deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\n",
      "She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\n",
      "girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\n",
      "foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet’s there could be little\n",
      "doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\n",
      "weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\n",
      "young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned\n",
      "very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\n",
      "there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\n",
      "with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin’s riding\n",
      "about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered\n",
      "by Mr. Elton’s admiration.\n",
      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but\n",
      "I think it a bad thing.”\n",
      "“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”\n",
      "“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”\n",
      "“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with\n",
      "a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have\n",
      "been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very\n",
      "differently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any good! This\n",
      "will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\n",
      "Knightley.”\n",
      "“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\n",
      "Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”\n",
      "“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he\n",
      "thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only\n",
      "yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there\n",
      "should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You\n",
      "are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a\n",
      "companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a\n",
      "woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\n",
      "it all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is\n",
      "not the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. But on\n",
      "the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an\n",
      "inducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She\n",
      "means it, I know.”\n",
      "“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years\n",
      "old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\n",
      "of books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists\n",
      "they were—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimes\n",
      "alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up\n",
      "when only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\n",
      "credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\n",
      "out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\n",
      "steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring\n",
      "industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\n",
      "understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\n",
      "affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade her\n",
      "to read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not.”\n",
      "“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought so\n",
      "_then_;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s omitting\n",
      "to do any thing I wished.”\n",
      "“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”—said\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “But I,”\n",
      "he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\n",
      "still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\n",
      "of her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able\n",
      "to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was\n",
      "always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since\n",
      "she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In\n",
      "her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits\n",
      "her mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”\n",
      "“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\n",
      "recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted another\n",
      "situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\n",
      "any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\n",
      "wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself\n",
      "to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\n",
      "not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\n",
      "promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on\n",
      "the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\n",
      "doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a\n",
      "wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.”\n",
      "“Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\n",
      "such a man as Mr. Weston.”\n",
      "“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\n",
      "that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\n",
      "We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness\n",
      "of comfort, or his son may plague him.”\n",
      "“I hope not _that_.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\n",
      "foretell vexation from that quarter.”\n",
      "“Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma’s\n",
      "genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\n",
      "young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But\n",
      "Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\n",
      "very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\n",
      "nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\n",
      "flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\n",
      "Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\n",
      "thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\n",
      "inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_\n",
      "cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of\n",
      "conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just\n",
      "refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\n",
      "circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s\n",
      "doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\n",
      "adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\n",
      "life.—They only give a little polish.”\n",
      "“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am more\n",
      "anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\n",
      "How well she looked last night!”\n",
      "“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\n",
      "well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”\n",
      "“Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\n",
      "beauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?”\n",
      "“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\n",
      "seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\n",
      "old friend.”\n",
      "“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features,\n",
      "open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\n",
      "and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\n",
      "There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\n",
      "glance. One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’\n",
      "now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\n",
      "grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”\n",
      "“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I think her\n",
      "all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\n",
      "that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\n",
      "she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\n",
      "another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\n",
      "Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”\n",
      "“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\n",
      "doing them any harm. With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is an\n",
      "excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\n",
      "sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\n",
      "trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\n",
      "lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\n",
      "times.”\n",
      "“Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\n",
      "I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and\n",
      "Isabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind\n",
      "affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not\n",
      "quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their\n",
      "opinions with me.”\n",
      "“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\n",
      "but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\n",
      "you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s\n",
      "mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\n",
      "possible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a\n",
      "matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\n",
      "little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\n",
      "expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\n",
      "approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\n",
      "source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\n",
      "give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this\n",
      "little remains of office.”\n",
      "“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\n",
      "good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\n",
      "found; for it shall be attended to.”\n",
      "“Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\n",
      "her sister.”\n",
      "“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\n",
      "ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\n",
      "does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\n",
      "perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\n",
      "feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!”\n",
      "“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”\n",
      "“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\n",
      "nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\n",
      "cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\n",
      "with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\n",
      "doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\n",
      "to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.”\n",
      "“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her\n",
      "resolution at present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be; and while\n",
      "she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any\n",
      "attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse’s account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,\n",
      "though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.”\n",
      "Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\n",
      "and Mr. Weston’s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\n",
      "at Randalls respecting Emma’s destiny, but it was not desirable to have\n",
      "them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\n",
      "afterwards made to “What does Weston think of the weather; shall we\n",
      "have rain?” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise\n",
      "about Hartfield.\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet’s fancy a proper\n",
      "direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\n",
      "purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\n",
      "and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\n",
      "admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of\n",
      "creating as much liking on Harriet’s side, as there could be any\n",
      "occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton’s being in the\n",
      "fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no\n",
      "scruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so\n",
      "warmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little\n",
      "time would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of\n",
      "Harriet’s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of\n",
      "the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.\n",
      "“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he; “you have\n",
      "made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came\n",
      "to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\n",
      "infinitely superior to what she received from nature.”\n",
      "“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\n",
      "drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\n",
      "natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\n",
      "done very little.”\n",
      "“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.\n",
      "Elton—\n",
      "“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\n",
      "taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”\n",
      "“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\n",
      "decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”\n",
      "“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\n",
      "more truly amiable.”\n",
      "“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\n",
      "animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\n",
      "another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\n",
      "to have Harriet’s picture.\n",
      "“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she: “did you\n",
      "ever sit for your picture?”\n",
      "Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\n",
      "with a very interesting naïveté,\n",
      "“Oh! dear, no, never.”\n",
      "No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\n",
      "“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\n",
      "give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\n",
      "You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\n",
      "passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\n",
      "was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\n",
      "another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\n",
      "if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\n",
      "picture!”\n",
      "“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. Elton; “it would indeed be a delight!\n",
      "Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in\n",
      "favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you\n",
      "suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\n",
      "landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\n",
      "figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”\n",
      "Yes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking\n",
      "likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don’t pretend to be in\n",
      "raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet’s face. “Well, if\n",
      "you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\n",
      "what I can do. Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a\n",
      "likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\n",
      "eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.”\n",
      "“Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I have\n",
      "not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\n",
      "it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.”\n",
      "“But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\n",
      "so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of\n",
      "answering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be\n",
      "drawn?’”\n",
      "“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\n",
      "I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”\n",
      "Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\n",
      "and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\n",
      "earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\n",
      "directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\n",
      "attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\n",
      "they might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\n",
      "beginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\n",
      "pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\n",
      "always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\n",
      "drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\n",
      "she would ever submit to. She played and sang;—and drew in almost every\n",
      "style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she\n",
      "approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to\n",
      "command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as\n",
      "to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\n",
      "unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\n",
      "accomplishment often higher than it deserved.\n",
      "There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps the\n",
      "most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\n",
      "there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\n",
      "companions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A\n",
      "likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse’s performances must be\n",
      "capital.\n",
      "“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only my own\n",
      "family to study from. There is my father—another of my father—but the\n",
      "idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\n",
      "take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\n",
      "again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\n",
      "kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\n",
      "There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and\n",
      "the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\n",
      "would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her\n",
      "four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\n",
      "attempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry and\n",
      "John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\n",
      "them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\n",
      "drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\n",
      "or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\n",
      "any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\n",
      "coarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my\n",
      "sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\n",
      "the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\n",
      "wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s\n",
      "very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\n",
      "is very good. Then here is my last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a\n",
      "gentleman in small size, whole-length—“my last and my best—my brother,\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I\n",
      "put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\n",
      "could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\n",
      "really made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite\n",
      "agreed in thinking it _very_ like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but\n",
      "that was a fault on the right side”—after all this, came poor dear\n",
      "Isabella’s cold approbation of—“Yes, it was a little like—but to be\n",
      "sure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\n",
      "persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\n",
      "altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\n",
      "it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\n",
      "morning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then\n",
      "forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather\n",
      "for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\n",
      "_present_, I will break my resolution now.”\n",
      "Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and\n",
      "was repeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\n",
      "you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a\n",
      "consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\n",
      "leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\n",
      "declaration must wait a little longer.\n",
      "She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\n",
      "whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley’s, and was\n",
      "destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\n",
      "station over the mantelpiece.\n",
      "The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\n",
      "keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\n",
      "youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\n",
      "doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\n",
      "touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\n",
      "and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\n",
      "it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\n",
      "to employ him in reading.\n",
      "“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\n",
      "indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\n",
      "the irksomeness of Miss Smith’s.”\n",
      "Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\n",
      "She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\n",
      "less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\n",
      "at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the\n",
      "progress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an\n",
      "encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\n",
      "before it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\n",
      "his complaisance were unexceptionable.\n",
      "The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\n",
      "pleased with the first day’s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\n",
      "of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\n",
      "to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\n",
      "height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\n",
      "being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\n",
      "destined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the\n",
      "beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\n",
      "as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton’s very promising\n",
      "attachment was likely to add.\n",
      "Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\n",
      "entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\n",
      "“By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\n",
      "party.”\n",
      "The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\n",
      "took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\n",
      "picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\n",
      "but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\n",
      "criticism.\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\n",
      "wanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least suspecting that\n",
      "she was addressing a lover.—“The expression of the eye is most correct,\n",
      "but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\n",
      "her face that she has them not.”\n",
      "“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears to\n",
      "me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\n",
      "likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”\n",
      "“You have made her too tall, Emma,” said Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\n",
      "added,\n",
      "“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,\n",
      "she is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short\n",
      "gives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\n",
      "Proportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\n",
      "such a height as Miss Smith’s. Exactly so indeed!”\n",
      "“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done! Just as\n",
      "your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\n",
      "well as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she\n",
      "seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\n",
      "shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold.”\n",
      "“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\n",
      "Look at the tree.”\n",
      "“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”\n",
      "“You, sir, may say any thing,” cried Mr. Elton, “but I must confess\n",
      "that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\n",
      "of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any\n",
      "other situation would have been much less in character. The naïveté of\n",
      "Miss Smith’s manners—and altogether—Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot\n",
      "keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”\n",
      "The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\n",
      "few difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\n",
      "the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose\n",
      "taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all\n",
      "commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in\n",
      "the fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.\n",
      "Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.\n",
      "“Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should\n",
      "he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was\n",
      "impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\n",
      "such an errand.”\n",
      "“He was too good!—she could not endure the thought!—she would not give\n",
      "him such a troublesome office for the world,”—brought on the desired\n",
      "repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled\n",
      "the business.\n",
      "Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\n",
      "the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\n",
      "safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\n",
      "not being incommoded enough.\n",
      "“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma. “I should\n",
      "say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\n",
      "being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\n",
      "exactly; it will be an ‘Exactly so,’ as he says himself; but he does\n",
      "sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\n",
      "endure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\n",
      "But it is his gratitude on Harriet’s account.”\n",
      "CHAPTER VII\n",
      "The very day of Mr. Elton’s going to London produced a fresh occasion\n",
      "for Emma’s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\n",
      "as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\n",
      "return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked\n",
      "of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\n",
      "extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\n",
      "minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\n",
      "finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\n",
      "little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\n",
      "opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs\n",
      "which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this\n",
      "letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal\n",
      "of marriage. “Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did\n",
      "not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good\n",
      "letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her\n",
      "very much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she\n",
      "could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—” Emma was half-ashamed\n",
      "of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\n",
      "“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any\n",
      "thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”\n",
      "“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do. I’d rather you\n",
      "would.”\n",
      "Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The\n",
      "style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not\n",
      "merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have\n",
      "disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and\n",
      "unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of\n",
      "the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,\n",
      "liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,\n",
      "while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a “Well,\n",
      "well,” and was at last forced to add, “Is it a good letter? or is it\n",
      "too short?”\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather slowly—“so good\n",
      "a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\n",
      "sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I\n",
      "saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\n",
      "left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\n",
      "no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\n",
      "woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\n",
      "talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand,\n",
      "his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,\n",
      "I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a\n",
      "certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning\n",
      "it,) than I had expected.”\n",
      "“Well,” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well—and—and what shall I do?”\n",
      "“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\n",
      "letter?”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and\n",
      "speedily.”\n",
      "“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”\n",
      "“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will\n",
      "express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your\n",
      "not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\n",
      "unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\n",
      "concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\n",
      "present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\n",
      "not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\n",
      "disappointment.”\n",
      "“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.\n",
      "“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\n",
      "doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\n",
      "under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you\n",
      "feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you\n",
      "were consulting me only as to the wording of it.”\n",
      "Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n",
      "“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”\n",
      "“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you\n",
      "advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\n",
      "with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”\n",
      "“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,\n",
      "contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\n",
      "silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\n",
      "letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n",
      "“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\n",
      "to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\n",
      "refuse him. If she can hesitate as to ‘Yes,’ she ought to say ‘No’\n",
      "directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\n",
      "feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\n",
      "older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I\n",
      "want to influence you.”\n",
      "“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would\n",
      "just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you\n",
      "say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be\n",
      "hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say ‘No,’\n",
      "perhaps.—Do you think I had better say ‘No?’”\n",
      "“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I advise you\n",
      "either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\n",
      "prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\n",
      "agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\n",
      "hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this\n",
      "moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\n",
      "yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\n",
      "moment whom are you thinking of?”\n",
      "The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\n",
      "confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\n",
      "still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without\n",
      "regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong\n",
      "hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said—\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as\n",
      "well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really\n",
      "almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”\n",
      "“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\n",
      "what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\n",
      "myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\n",
      "in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have\n",
      "grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\n",
      "consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\n",
      "degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not\n",
      "influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could\n",
      "not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am\n",
      "secure of you for ever.”\n",
      "Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\n",
      "forcibly.\n",
      "“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “No, to be\n",
      "sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\n",
      "been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\n",
      "give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any\n",
      "thing in the world.”\n",
      "“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\n",
      "must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\n",
      "I must have given you up.”\n",
      "“Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\n",
      "never to come to Hartfield any more!”\n",
      "“Dear affectionate creature!—_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—_You_\n",
      "confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\n",
      "wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\n",
      "have a pretty good opinion of himself.”\n",
      "“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet, her\n",
      "conscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,\n",
      "and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\n",
      "for—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he\n",
      "may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must\n",
      "confess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes\n",
      "to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\n",
      "_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\n",
      "Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\n",
      "his being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as\n",
      "to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.”\n",
      "“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\n",
      "parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\n",
      "because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”\n",
      "“Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.”\n",
      "Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very\n",
      "true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\n",
      "manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\n",
      "her husband could write a good letter.”\n",
      "“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\n",
      "happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\n",
      "But how shall I do? What shall I say?”\n",
      "Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\n",
      "advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\n",
      "her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\n",
      "assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\n",
      "sentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\n",
      "such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\n",
      "her up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\n",
      "concerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\n",
      "what his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\n",
      "that they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\n",
      "young man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\n",
      "accepted after all.\n",
      "This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\n",
      "was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\n",
      "Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\n",
      "by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\n",
      "idea of Mr. Elton.\n",
      "“I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather a\n",
      "sorrowful tone.\n",
      "“Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\n",
      "are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\n",
      "Abbey-Mill.”\n",
      "“And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\n",
      "but at Hartfield.”\n",
      "Some time afterwards it was, “I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\n",
      "surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for\n",
      "Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\n",
      "linen-draper.”\n",
      "“One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\n",
      "of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\n",
      "opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\n",
      "valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\n",
      "is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\n",
      "among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\n",
      "the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\n",
      "themselves.”\n",
      "Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\n",
      "people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\n",
      "cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\n",
      "the rejected Mr. Martin.\n",
      "“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what they are\n",
      "all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will be\n",
      "unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.”\n",
      "“Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\n",
      "employed,” cried Emma. “At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\n",
      "your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\n",
      "is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\n",
      "allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.”\n",
      "“My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street.”\n",
      "“Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\n",
      "Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\n",
      "just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\n",
      "evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\n",
      "it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\n",
      "pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\n",
      "prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\n",
      "their imaginations all are!”\n",
      "Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n",
      "Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\n",
      "spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a\n",
      "bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\n",
      "respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\n",
      "just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\n",
      "two to Mrs. Goddard’s, but it was then to be settled that she should\n",
      "return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\n",
      "While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\n",
      "mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and\n",
      "was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of\n",
      "his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his\n",
      "short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies\n",
      "and civil hesitations of the other.\n",
      "“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\n",
      "consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma’s advice and\n",
      "go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\n",
      "better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.”\n",
      "“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”\n",
      "“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\n",
      "entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\n",
      "three turns—my winter walk.”\n",
      "“You cannot do better, sir.”\n",
      "“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am\n",
      "a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides,\n",
      "you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.”\n",
      "“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\n",
      "the sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open\n",
      "the garden door for you.”\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\n",
      "immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\n",
      "chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\n",
      "voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\n",
      "“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a pretty\n",
      "little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\n",
      "disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\n",
      "hands she will turn out a valuable woman.”\n",
      "“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\n",
      "wanting.”\n",
      "“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\n",
      "that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s\n",
      "giggle; she really does you credit.”\n",
      "“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had\n",
      "been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where\n",
      "they may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.”\n",
      "“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”\n",
      "“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\n",
      "intended.”\n",
      "“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”\n",
      "“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”\n",
      "“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”\n",
      "Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\n",
      "nothing. He presently added, with a smile,\n",
      "“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I\n",
      "have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\n",
      "something to her advantage.”\n",
      "“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”\n",
      "“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.\n",
      "“Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her?\n",
      "Who makes you their confidant?”\n",
      "Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton’s having dropt a hint.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked up to him.\n",
      "“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon\n",
      "have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\n",
      "quarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this\n",
      "summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and\n",
      "means to marry her.”\n",
      "“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to\n",
      "marry him?”\n",
      "“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\n",
      "the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\n",
      "I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\n",
      "considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I\n",
      "thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\n",
      "thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\n",
      "altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n",
      "(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\n",
      "above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\n",
      "better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\n",
      "purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\n",
      "thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\n",
      "the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\n",
      "and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\n",
      "me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\n",
      "could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\n",
      "him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\n",
      "would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\n",
      "thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\n",
      "the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not\n",
      "allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\n",
      "appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be\n",
      "at Mrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without\n",
      "thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.”\n",
      "“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\n",
      "through a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin\n",
      "did not speak yesterday?”\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know it; but\n",
      "it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”\n",
      "“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for what you\n",
      "have told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was\n",
      "refused.”\n",
      "This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\n",
      "Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\n",
      "stood up, in tall indignation, and said,\n",
      "“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\n",
      "foolish girl about?”\n",
      "“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man\n",
      "that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\n",
      "imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”\n",
      "“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\n",
      "meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\n",
      "so; but I hope you are mistaken.”\n",
      "“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”\n",
      "“You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\n",
      "doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”\n",
      "“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\n",
      "feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\n",
      "but I cannot admit him to be Harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized\n",
      "indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\n",
      "does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\n",
      "got over.”\n",
      "“Not Harriet’s equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\n",
      "with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is not\n",
      "her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\n",
      "situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\n",
      "Harriet Smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\n",
      "connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\n",
      "nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\n",
      "certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\n",
      "parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\n",
      "girl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\n",
      "young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\n",
      "can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\n",
      "ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\n",
      "tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\n",
      "his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\n",
      "I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\n",
      "and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\n",
      "worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\n",
      "trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\n",
      "disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\n",
      "and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\n",
      "her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\n",
      "would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\n",
      "satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\n",
      "would not regret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\n",
      "being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, ‘Even Emma, with\n",
      "all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.’”\n",
      "“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\n",
      "any such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\n",
      "his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\n",
      "friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\n",
      "whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\n",
      "should think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\n",
      "mine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\n",
      "You are not just to Harriet’s claims. They would be estimated very\n",
      "differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\n",
      "of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\n",
      "society.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a\n",
      "degradation.”\n",
      "“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\n",
      "respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”\n",
      "“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\n",
      "be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\n",
      "for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\n",
      "whom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\n",
      "is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very\n",
      "liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\n",
      "comfort.—That she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me; that\n",
      "she associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\n",
      "deny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”\n",
      "“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever may have\n",
      "had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\n",
      "their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\n",
      "After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s line, to have Mrs. Goddard’s acquaintance. Her friends\n",
      "evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\n",
      "She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a\n",
      "friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\n",
      "beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.\n",
      "She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given\n",
      "it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would\n",
      "never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not\n",
      "being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling\n",
      "to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to\n",
      "conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it\n",
      "he had encouragement.”\n",
      "It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\n",
      "assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\n",
      "unjust to Harriet. Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so\n",
      "contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\n",
      "has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\n",
      "her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\n",
      "however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\n",
      "good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\n",
      "they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\n",
      "is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\n",
      "people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\n",
      "philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\n",
      "till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\n",
      "faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\n",
      "being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\n",
      "among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\n",
      "not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\n",
      "sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\n",
      "great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\n",
      "mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\n",
      "temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.”\n",
      "“Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\n",
      "enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\n",
      "it as you do.”\n",
      "“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know _that_ is the feeling of you\n",
      "all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man\n",
      "delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\n",
      "judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\n",
      "marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\n",
      "entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\n",
      "because she does not accept the first offer she receives? No—pray let\n",
      "her have time to look about her.”\n",
      "“I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said Mr. Knightley\n",
      "presently, “though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\n",
      "perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will\n",
      "puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a\n",
      "claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good\n",
      "enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of\n",
      "mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations\n",
      "too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so\n",
      "fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may\n",
      "chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very\n",
      "fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most\n",
      "prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they\n",
      "might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be\n",
      "revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable,\n",
      "and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry\n",
      "greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of\n",
      "consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is\n",
      "a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and\n",
      "is glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.”\n",
      "“We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\n",
      "can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\n",
      "angry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is\n",
      "impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must\n",
      "prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having\n",
      "refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will\n",
      "not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I\n",
      "assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His\n",
      "appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she\n",
      "ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that\n",
      "before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was\n",
      "the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and\n",
      "altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great\n",
      "assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him\n",
      "disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen\n",
      "are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\n",
      "with Harriet.”\n",
      "“Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried Mr.\n",
      "Knightley.—“Robert Martin’s manners have sense, sincerity, and\n",
      "good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility\n",
      "than Harriet Smith could understand.”\n",
      "Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\n",
      "really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\n",
      "did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\n",
      "judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\n",
      "but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\n",
      "which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\n",
      "sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\n",
      "Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\n",
      "on Emma’s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\n",
      "thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\n",
      "“Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope it\n",
      "will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\n",
      "to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\n",
      "is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as\n",
      "a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\n",
      "will be all labour in vain.”\n",
      "Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\n",
      "“Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\n",
      "and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\n",
      "an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\n",
      "body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\n",
      "as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet’s.\n",
      "He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\n",
      "wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\n",
      "moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\n",
      "not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\n",
      "animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\n",
      "intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.”\n",
      "“I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again. “If I had\n",
      "set my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would have been very\n",
      "kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\n",
      "myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\n",
      "equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.”\n",
      "“Good morning to you,”—said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\n",
      "very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\n",
      "mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\n",
      "had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\n",
      "affair, was provoking him exceedingly.\n",
      "Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\n",
      "indistinctness in the causes of her’s, than in his. She did not always\n",
      "feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\n",
      "her opinions were right and her adversary’s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\n",
      "walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\n",
      "was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\n",
      "the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet’s\n",
      "staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\n",
      "of the young man’s coming to Mrs. Goddard’s that morning, and meeting\n",
      "with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\n",
      "of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\n",
      "Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\n",
      "reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\n",
      "settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\n",
      "Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\n",
      "woman’s friendship and woman’s feelings would not justify.\n",
      "He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\n",
      "that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\n",
      "with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\n",
      "of Mr. Knightley’s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\n",
      "such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\n",
      "she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\n",
      "resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\n",
      "might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\n",
      "done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\n",
      "disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\n",
      "than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\n",
      "allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\n",
      "interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\n",
      "thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\n",
      "doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\n",
      "might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\n",
      "of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\n",
      "Harriet’s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\n",
      "to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\n",
      "telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\n",
      "delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard’s to attend a sick child,\n",
      "and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\n",
      "coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\n",
      "found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\n",
      "London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\n",
      "whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\n",
      "Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\n",
      "was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\n",
      "to persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\n",
      "do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\n",
      "_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\n",
      "not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\n",
      "enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\n",
      "precious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\n",
      "sure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\n",
      "Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\n",
      "spirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\n",
      "more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\n",
      "“that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\n",
      "she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\n",
      "think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton\n",
      "had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.”\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\n",
      "herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual\n",
      "before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave\n",
      "looks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not\n",
      "repent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more\n",
      "justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next\n",
      "few days.\n",
      "The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\n",
      "sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half\n",
      "sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet’s\n",
      "feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and\n",
      "steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was\n",
      "soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin’s being no otherwise remembered,\n",
      "than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage\n",
      "to the latter.\n",
      "Her views of improving her little friend’s mind, by a great deal of\n",
      "useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\n",
      "first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\n",
      "easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\n",
      "range and work at Harriet’s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\n",
      "her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\n",
      "pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\n",
      "was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\n",
      "all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\n",
      "quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\n",
      "ciphers and trophies.\n",
      "In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\n",
      "not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard’s, had written\n",
      "out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint\n",
      "of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse’s help, to get a great many\n",
      "more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as\n",
      "Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of\n",
      "the first order, in form as well as quantity.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\n",
      "girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\n",
      "in. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he\n",
      "wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.”\n",
      "And it always ended in “Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.”\n",
      "His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did\n",
      "not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had\n",
      "desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\n",
      "something, he thought, might come from that quarter.\n",
      "It was by no means his daughter’s wish that the intellects of Highbury\n",
      "in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\n",
      "whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really\n",
      "good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she\n",
      "had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his\n",
      "recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most\n",
      "earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe\n",
      "a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their\n",
      "two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at\n",
      "last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known\n",
      "charade,\n",
      "My first doth affliction denote,\n",
      "    Which my second is destin’d to feel\n",
      "And my whole is the best antidote\n",
      "    That affliction to soften and heal.—\n",
      "made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\n",
      "pages ago already.\n",
      "“Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?” said she;\n",
      "“that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\n",
      "easier to you.”\n",
      "“Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\n",
      "life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse”—he\n",
      "stopt a moment—“or Miss Smith could inspire him.”\n",
      "The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called\n",
      "for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\n",
      "containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\n",
      "to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\n",
      "manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\n",
      "“I do not offer it for Miss Smith’s collection,” said he. “Being my\n",
      "friend’s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\n",
      "but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.”\n",
      "The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\n",
      "understand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it\n",
      "easier to meet her eye than her friend’s. He was gone the next\n",
      "moment:—after another moment’s pause,\n",
      "“Take it,” said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\n",
      "Harriet—“it is for you. Take your own.”\n",
      "But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\n",
      "loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\n",
      "To Miss——\n",
      "CHARADE.\n",
      "My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n",
      "    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\n",
      "Another view of man, my second brings,\n",

      "    Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\n",
      "    May its approval beam in that soft eye!\n",
      "She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\n",
      "again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\n",
      "passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\n",
      "while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope\n",
      "and dulness, “Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\n",
      "charades. _Courtship_—a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\n",
      "is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly—‘Pray, Miss Smith,\n",
      "give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\n",
      "intentions in the same glance.’\n",
      "May its approval beam in that soft eye!\n",
      "Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets, the\n",
      "justest that could be given.\n",
      "Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\n",
      "Humph—Harriet’s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\n",
      "love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\n",
      "benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\n",
      "you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\n",
      "indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\n",
      "which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\n",
      "eagerness of Harriet’s wondering questions.\n",
      "“What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an idea—I\n",
      "cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\n",
      "it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is\n",
      "it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young\n",
      "lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\n",
      "And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n",
      "Can it be Neptune?\n",
      "Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n",
      "Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\n",
      "syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?”\n",
      "“Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\n",
      "of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a\n",
      "friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\n",
      "For Miss ———, read Miss Smith.\n",
      "My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n",
      "    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\n",
      "That is _court_.\n",
      "Another view of man, my second brings;\n",
      "    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n",
      "That is _ship_;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream.\n",
      "But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\n",
      "    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\n",
      "Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n",
      "    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n",
      "A very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I\n",
      "think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\n",
      "comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\n",
      "its being written for you and to you.”\n",
      "Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the\n",
      "concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\n",
      "speak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\n",
      "Emma spoke for her.\n",
      "“There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,”\n",
      "said she, “that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton’s intentions. You\n",
      "are his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\n",
      "thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now,\n",
      "it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my\n",
      "wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet,\n",
      "just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that\n",
      "has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and\n",
      "Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its\n",
      "eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I\n",
      "congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an\n",
      "attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a\n",
      "connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing\n",
      "that you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix\n",
      "you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to\n",
      "me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance\n",
      "which can never raise a blush in either of us.”\n",
      "“Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and “Dear Miss Woodhouse,” was all that Harriet,\n",
      "with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\n",
      "arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear\n",
      "to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as\n",
      "she ought. Mr. Elton’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\n",
      "“Whatever you say is always right,” cried Harriet, “and therefore I\n",
      "suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\n",
      "have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\n",
      "who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\n",
      "is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses—‘To Miss ———.’\n",
      "Dear me, how clever!—Could it really be meant for me?”\n",
      "“I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\n",
      "certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the\n",
      "play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\n",
      "matter-of-fact prose.”\n",
      "“It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a\n",
      "month ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take\n",
      "place!”\n",
      "“When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and\n",
      "really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\n",
      "evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of\n",
      "other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\n",
      "You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\n",
      "another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\n",
      "will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\n",
      "something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\n",
      "direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\n",
      "The course of true love never did run smooth—\n",
      "A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\n",
      "passage.”\n",
      "“That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all people,\n",
      "who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\n",
      "handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\n",
      "quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\n",
      "says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\n",
      "that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\n",
      "excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\n",
      "ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\n",
      "to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!—The two Abbots and\n",
      "I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\n",
      "was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\n",
      "through herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look\n",
      "too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\n",
      "looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.”\n",
      "“This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be, must\n",
      "be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\n",
      "are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\n",
      "see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\n",
      "every assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same\n",
      "country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\n",
      "be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\n",
      "common phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\n",
      "respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\n",
      "understand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\n",
      "other. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have\n",
      "made any thing like it.”\n",
      "“I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\n",
      "yesterday.”\n",
      "“I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.”\n",
      "“I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.”\n",
      "“It is as long again as almost all we have had before.”\n",
      "“I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\n",
      "things in general cannot be too short.”\n",
      "Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\n",
      "comparisons were rising in her mind.\n",
      "“It is one thing,” said she, presently—her cheeks in a glow—“to have\n",
      "very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\n",
      "any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\n",
      "must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\n",
      "this.”\n",
      "Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin’s\n",
      "prose.\n",
      "“Such sweet lines!” continued Harriet—“these two last!—But how shall I\n",
      "ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?—Oh! Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, what can we do about that?”\n",
      "“Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\n",
      "say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\n",
      "pass between us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall\n",
      "chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.”\n",
      "“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\n",
      "charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.”\n",
      "“Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\n",
      "not write it into your book.”\n",
      "“Oh! but those two lines are”—\n",
      "—“The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for private\n",
      "enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\n",
      "because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\n",
      "meaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\n",
      "very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\n",
      "upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\n",
      "than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\n",
      "or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\n",
      "be no possible reflection on you.”\n",
      "Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\n",
      "as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\n",
      "declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\n",
      "of publicity.\n",
      "“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.\n",
      "“Very well,” replied Emma; “a most natural feeling; and the longer it\n",
      "lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\n",
      "will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\n",
      "so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\n",
      "thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\n",
      "gallantry towards us all!—You must let me read it to him.”\n",
      "Harriet looked grave.\n",
      "“My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You\n",
      "will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\n",
      "quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\n",
      "which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\n",
      "tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\n",
      "have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\n",
      "than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\n",
      "encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\n",
      "this charade.”\n",
      "“Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.”\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\n",
      "recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “Well, my dears, how does\n",
      "your book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?”\n",
      "“Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\n",
      "piece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose,\n",
      "by a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\n",
      "it in.”\n",
      "She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\n",
      "distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\n",
      "part as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\n",
      "foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\n",
      "“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. Very true.\n",
      "‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\n",
      "easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so\n",
      "prettily, but you, Emma.”\n",
      "Emma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very\n",
      "tender sigh, he added,\n",
      "“Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\n",
      "was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\n",
      "remember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard\n",
      "me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\n",
      "several.\n",
      "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\n",
      "    Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\n",
      "The hood-wink’d boy I called to aid,\n",
      "Though of his near approach afraid,\n",
      "    So fatal to my suit before.\n",
      "And that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all\n",
      "the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.”\n",
      "“Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\n",
      "Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick’s, you know.”\n",
      "“Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.\n",
      "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\n",
      "The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\n",
      "christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\n",
      "next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what\n",
      "room there will be for the children?”\n",
      "“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\n",
      "has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you\n",
      "know. Why should there be any change?”\n",
      "“I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since\n",
      "last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John Knightley’s being a\n",
      "lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away\n",
      "from us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\n",
      "Taylor here!”\n",
      "“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”\n",
      "“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\n",
      "first heard she was going to be married.”\n",
      "“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "“Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is\n",
      "coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.”\n",
      "“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of\n",
      "necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\n",
      "ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\n",
      "they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\n",
      "taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\n",
      "this Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him,\n",
      "than with us.”\n",
      "“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\n",
      "anywhere but at Hartfield.”\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley’s claims on his\n",
      "brother, or any body’s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\n",
      "musing a little while, and then said,\n",
      "“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\n",
      "soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\n",
      "stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.”\n",
      "“Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\n",
      "not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\n",
      "husband.”\n",
      "This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\n",
      "by the idea of his daughter’s attachment to her husband, she\n",
      "immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\n",
      "“Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\n",
      "brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\n",
      "children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\n",
      "which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?”\n",
      "“Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\n",
      "to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.”\n",
      "“I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.”\n",
      "“Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\n",
      "eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\n",
      "is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\n",
      "the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\n",
      "thought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\n",
      "are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\n",
      "come and stand by my chair, and say, ‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\n",
      "of string?’ and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\n",
      "were only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\n",
      "them very often.”\n",
      "“He appears rough to you,” said Emma, “because you are so very gentle\n",
      "yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\n",
      "think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\n",
      "misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\n",
      "affectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\n",
      "father. The children are all fond of him.”\n",
      "“And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\n",
      "very frightful way!”\n",
      "“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\n",
      "enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\n",
      "their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.”\n",
      "“Well, I cannot understand it.”\n",
      "“That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\n",
      "understand the pleasures of the other.”\n",
      "Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\n",
      "preparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this\n",
      "inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\n",
      "receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\n",
      "his the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and\n",
      "she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\n",
      "reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse’s party could be made\n",
      "up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\n",
      "degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\n",
      "way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\n",
      "dining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\n",
      "conditionally to come.\n",
      "Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\n",
      "on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she\n",
      "re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\n",
      "paper from the table, she returned it—\n",
      "“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\n",
      "thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\n",
      "ventured to write it into Miss Smith’s collection. Your friend will not\n",
      "take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\n",
      "eight lines.”\n",
      "Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\n",
      "rather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about\n",
      "“honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open\n",
      "on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the\n",
      "view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\n",
      "“You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\n",
      "not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s\n",
      "approbation while he writes with such gallantry.”\n",
      "“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\n",
      "a good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying—at least if\n",
      "my friend feels at all as _I_ do—I have not the smallest doubt that,\n",
      "could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at\n",
      "the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as\n",
      "the proudest moment of his life.”\n",
      "After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\n",
      "it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a\n",
      "sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\n",
      "laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\n",
      "the sublime of pleasure to Harriet’s share.\n",
      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\n",
      "prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\n",
      "morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\n",
      "lived a little way out of Highbury.\n",
      "Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\n",
      "leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\n",
      "of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\n",
      "Mr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\n",
      "about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\n",
      "not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\n",
      "no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\n",
      "present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\n",
      "of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\n",
      "eyes.—Emma’s remark was—\n",
      "“There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\n",
      "days.”—Harriet’s was—\n",
      "“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow\n",
      "curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”\n",
      "“I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded,\n",
      "“but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\n",
      "intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\n",
      "this part of Highbury.”\n",
      "Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\n",
      "her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\n",
      "probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s seeing ready wit in her.\n",
      "“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think of any\n",
      "tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire\n",
      "about of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”\n",
      "She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\n",
      "some minutes, Harriet thus began again—\n",
      "“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\n",
      "going to be married! so charming as you are!”—\n",
      "Emma laughed, and replied,\n",
      "“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\n",
      "I must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am\n",
      "not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\n",
      "intention of ever marrying at all.”\n",
      "“Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.”\n",
      "“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\n",
      "tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\n",
      "question: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\n",
      "not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\n",
      "marry, I must expect to repent it.”\n",
      "“Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”—\n",
      "“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\n",
      "in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\n",
      "in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\n",
      "shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\n",
      "situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\n",
      "consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\n",
      "mistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\n",
      "never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\n",
      "first and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.”\n",
      "“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”\n",
      "“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\n",
      "thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so\n",
      "smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to\n",
      "tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\n",
      "to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\n",
      "likeness, except in being unmarried.”\n",
      "“But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!”\n",
      "“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\n",
      "only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\n",
      "woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\n",
      "old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\n",
      "good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\n",
      "pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\n",
      "against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\n",
      "for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\n",
      "the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\n",
      "small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\n",
      "cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\n",
      "good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\n",
      "much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\n",
      "certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\n",
      "only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\n",
      "sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.”\n",
      "“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\n",
      "grow old?”\n",
      "“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\n",
      "many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\n",
      "in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman’s\n",
      "usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\n",
      "are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\n",
      "more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\n",
      "objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\n",
      "great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\n",
      "to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\n",
      "children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\n",
      "enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\n",
      "that declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\n",
      "every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\n",
      "parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\n",
      "blinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.”\n",
      "“Do you know Miss Bates’s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\n",
      "a hundred times—but are you acquainted?”\n",
      "“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\n",
      "Highbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\n",
      "with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\n",
      "half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\n",
      "Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\n",
      "from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\n",
      "round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\n",
      "a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\n",
      "of nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\n",
      "tires me to death.”\n",
      "They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\n",
      "superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\n",
      "were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\n",
      "counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\n",
      "could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\n",
      "expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\n",
      "done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\n",
      "always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\n",
      "the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\n",
      "came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\n",
      "comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\n",
      "the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\n",
      "“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\n",
      "every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\n",
      "these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\n",
      "soon it may all vanish from my mind?”\n",
      "“Very true,” said Harriet. “Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\n",
      "else.”\n",
      "“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said\n",
      "Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\n",
      "the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\n",
      "into the lane again. “I do not think it will,” stopping to look once\n",
      "more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\n",
      "greater within.\n",
      "“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.\n",
      "They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\n",
      "passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\n",
      "time only to say farther,\n",
      "“Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\n",
      "thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\n",
      "has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\n",
      "is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we\n",
      "can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to\n",
      "ourselves.”\n",
      "Harriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman joined\n",
      "them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\n",
      "first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\n",
      "he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what\n",
      "could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\n",
      "accompany them.\n",
      "“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma;\n",
      "“to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of\n",
      "love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\n",
      "declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.”\n",
      "Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\n",
      "afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\n",
      "side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\n",
      "not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet’s habits of\n",
      "dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\n",
      "they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\n",
      "stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\n",
      "of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\n",
      "footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\n",
      "follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\n",
      "she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\n",
      "comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\n",
      "the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\n",
      "fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\n",
      "to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\n",
      "have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\n",
      "design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\n",
      "without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\n",
      "involuntarily: the child’s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\n",
      "she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\n",
      "conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\n",
      "animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\n",
      "having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\n",
      "back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\n",
      "to join them.\n",
      "Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\n",
      "and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was\n",
      "only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday’s party at\n",
      "his friend Cole’s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\n",
      "cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and\n",
      "all the dessert.\n",
      "“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her\n",
      "consoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and\n",
      "any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\n",
      "could but have kept longer away!”\n",
      "They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\n",
      "pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\n",
      "house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\n",
      "and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off\n",
      "short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged\n",
      "to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself\n",
      "to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\n",
      "“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I am to\n",
      "contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\n",
      "hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\n",
      "stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or\n",
      "string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.”\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\n",
      "exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house\n",
      "and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they\n",
      "were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\n",
      "behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\n",
      "between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to\n",
      "receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\n",
      "to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\n",
      "Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\n",
      "ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\n",
      "hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\n",
      "adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\n",
      "could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and\n",
      "make her appearance.\n",
      "The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\n",
      "favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\n",
      "having schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\n",
      "the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\n",
      "Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\n",
      "other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\n",
      "serious.\n",
      "“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by inch, and\n",
      "will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”\n",
      "Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\n",
      "ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\n",
      "the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\n",
      "them forward to the great event.\n",
      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma’s power\n",
      "to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\n",
      "sister’s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\n",
      "and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\n",
      "and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\n",
      "expected—she did not herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional,\n",
      "fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They\n",
      "might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow\n",
      "or other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more\n",
      "leisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the\n",
      "less they will do for themselves.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\n",
      "from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual\n",
      "interest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had\n",
      "been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays\n",
      "of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it\n",
      "was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by\n",
      "their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not\n",
      "be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella’s sake; and\n",
      "who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\n",
      "forestalling this too short visit.\n",
      "He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\n",
      "of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\n",
      "of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\n",
      "the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\n",
      "Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of\n",
      "nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of\n",
      "such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and\n",
      "variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion\n",
      "which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\n",
      "endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the\n",
      "feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that\n",
      "in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her\n",
      "little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and\n",
      "attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\n",
      "which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the\n",
      "children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in\n",
      "themselves or in any restless attendance on them.\n",
      "Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\n",
      "quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\n",
      "wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so\n",
      "tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher\n",
      "ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a\n",
      "fault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or\n",
      "any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited\n",
      "also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,\n",
      "over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,\n",
      "and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\n",
      "of Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,\n",
      "and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\n",
      "rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\n",
      "character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\n",
      "generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He\n",
      "was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to\n",
      "deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;\n",
      "and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that\n",
      "any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme\n",
      "sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and\n",
      "quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an\n",
      "ungracious, or say a severe thing.\n",
      "He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\n",
      "in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\n",
      "Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\n",
      "passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella’s sister,\n",
      "but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\n",
      "praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\n",
      "compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all\n",
      "in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\n",
      "forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\n",
      "that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse’s peculiarities and\n",
      "fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\n",
      "sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.\n",
      "John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and\n",
      "generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often\n",
      "for Emma’s charity, especially as there was all the pain of\n",
      "apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The\n",
      "beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest\n",
      "feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass\n",
      "away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and\n",
      "composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a\n",
      "sigh, called his daughter’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield\n",
      "since she had been there last.\n",
      "“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor—It is a grievous business.”\n",
      "“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her!\n",
      "And dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I have been so\n",
      "grieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\n",
      "her.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty well, sir.”\n",
      "“Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that the\n",
      "place agrees with her tolerably.”\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\n",
      "doubts of the air of Randalls.\n",
      "“Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\n",
      "life—never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”\n",
      "“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.\n",
      "“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the\n",
      "plaintive tone which just suited her father.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.”\n",
      "“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\n",
      "married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\n",
      "have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\n",
      "either at Randalls or here—and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\n",
      "frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\n",
      "is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy\n",
      "way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body\n",
      "must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought\n",
      "also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our\n",
      "missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which\n",
      "is the exact truth.”\n",
      "“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as I hoped\n",
      "it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not\n",
      "be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\n",
      "easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\n",
      "the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\n",
      "now you have Emma’s account, I hope you will be satisfied.”\n",
      "“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes, certainly—I cannot deny\n",
      "that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\n",
      "often—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.”\n",
      "“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite\n",
      "forget poor Mr. Weston.”\n",
      "“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has\n",
      "some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\n",
      "the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\n",
      "claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\n",
      "Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\n",
      "putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.”\n",
      "“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.—\n",
      "“Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\n",
      "greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\n",
      "the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\n",
      "Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\n",
      "slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\n",
      "nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\n",
      "best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\n",
      "brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\n",
      "flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever\n",
      "since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\n",
      "that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\n",
      "there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\n",
      "not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body\n",
      "can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”\n",
      "“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been here on\n",
      "this occasion—or has he not?”\n",
      "“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong\n",
      "expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\n",
      "nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”\n",
      "“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father. “He\n",
      "wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\n",
      "proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\n",
      "well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\n",
      "cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—”\n",
      "“My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.”\n",
      "“Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought it—and\n",
      "he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\n",
      "fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\n",
      "good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\n",
      "pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n",
      "28th—and began, ‘My dear Madam,’ but I forget how it went on; and it\n",
      "was signed ‘F. C. Weston Churchill.’—I remember that perfectly.”\n",
      "“How very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\n",
      "Knightley. “I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\n",
      "how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\n",
      "something so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents\n",
      "and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\n",
      "with him. To give up one’s child! I really never could think well of\n",
      "any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.”\n",
      "“Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,” observed Mr.\n",
      "John Knightley coolly. “But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\n",
      "felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\n",
      "rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\n",
      "he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\n",
      "or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\n",
      "for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\n",
      "playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\n",
      "affection, or any thing that home affords.”\n",
      "Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and\n",
      "had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\n",
      "would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable\n",
      "and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home\n",
      "to himself, whence resulted her brother’s disposition to look down on\n",
      "the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\n",
      "important.—It had a high claim to forbearance.\n",
      "CHAPTER XII\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\n",
      "Isabella’s first day. Emma’s sense of right however had decided it; and\n",
      "besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\n",
      "particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\n",
      "between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\n",
      "invitation.\n",
      "She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\n",
      "to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\n",
      "in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\n",
      "out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\n",
      "ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration\n",
      "of friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the\n",
      "children with her—the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months\n",
      "old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to\n",
      "be danced about in her aunt’s arms. It did assist; for though he began\n",
      "with grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of\n",
      "them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with\n",
      "all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends\n",
      "again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and\n",
      "then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring\n",
      "the baby,\n",
      "“What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and\n",
      "nieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\n",
      "but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.”\n",
      "“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and\n",
      "women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings\n",
      "with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might\n",
      "always think alike.”\n",
      "“To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\n",
      "wrong.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\n",
      "you were born.”\n",
      "“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt you were much\n",
      "my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\n",
      "lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\n",
      "nearer?”\n",
      "“Yes—a good deal _nearer_.”\n",
      "“But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\n",
      "think differently.”\n",
      "“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience, and by\n",
      "not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\n",
      "let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\n",
      "Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\n",
      "old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.”\n",
      "“That’s true,” she cried—“very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\n",
      "woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\n",
      "Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\n",
      "intentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects\n",
      "on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know\n",
      "that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”\n",
      "“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer.\n",
      "“Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with me.”\n",
      "This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\n",
      "Knightley made his appearance, and “How d’ye do, George?” and “John,\n",
      "how are you?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\n",
      "calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which\n",
      "would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the\n",
      "good of the other.\n",
      "The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\n",
      "entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\n",
      "the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\n",
      "daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\n",
      "distinct, or very rarely mixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in\n",
      "one or the other.\n",
      "The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\n",
      "of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\n",
      "and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had\n",
      "generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some\n",
      "curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\n",
      "home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\n",
      "year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\n",
      "interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\n",
      "part of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\n",
      "drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\n",
      "destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\n",
      "entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\n",
      "manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\n",
      "thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\n",
      "eagerness.\n",
      "While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\n",
      "full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\n",
      "“My poor dear Isabella,” said he, fondly taking her hand, and\n",
      "interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\n",
      "five children—“How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\n",
      "And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\n",
      "my dear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—You and I\n",
      "will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\n",
      "have a little gruel.”\n",
      "Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both\n",
      "the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as\n",
      "herself;—and two basins only were ordered. After a little more\n",
      "discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being\n",
      "taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of\n",
      "grave reflection,\n",
      "“It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\n",
      "End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.”\n",
      "“Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should not\n",
      "have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\n",
      "the weakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.”\n",
      "“Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\n",
      "good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\n",
      "perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\n",
      "to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.”\n",
      "“Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, “I must\n",
      "beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I\n",
      "who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\n",
      "Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet;\n",
      "and he never forgets you.”\n",
      "“Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?”\n",
      "“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he\n",
      "has not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to\n",
      "take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all\n",
      "round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice\n",
      "anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.”\n",
      "“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I\n",
      "have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\n",
      "will be so pleased to see my little ones.”\n",
      "“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\n",
      "him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\n",
      "you had better let him look at little Bella’s throat.”\n",
      "“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\n",
      "uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\n",
      "her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\n",
      "Wingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”\n",
      "“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\n",
      "to her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\n",
      "spoken to—\n",
      "“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma, “I\n",
      "have not heard one inquiry after them.”\n",
      "“Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them\n",
      "in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\n",
      "Bates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.—They are\n",
      "always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss\n",
      "Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they, sir?”\n",
      "“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\n",
      "bad cold about a month ago.”\n",
      "“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\n",
      "this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\n",
      "general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”\n",
      "“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\n",
      "mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\n",
      "as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\n",
      "altogether a sickly season.”\n",
      "“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\n",
      "except—\n",
      "“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\n",
      "sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\n",
      "dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!—and the\n",
      "air so bad!”\n",
      "“No, indeed—_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\n",
      "very superior to most others!—You must not confound us with London in\n",
      "general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\n",
      "different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\n",
      "unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is\n",
      "hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but\n",
      "_we_ are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\n",
      "Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.”\n",
      "“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but\n",
      "after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\n",
      "creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I\n",
      "think you are any of you looking well at present.”\n",
      "“I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\n",
      "little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\n",
      "free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\n",
      "rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\n",
      "little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\n",
      "coming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\n",
      "assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\n",
      "sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you\n",
      "do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes with\n",
      "affectionate anxiety towards her husband.\n",
      "“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\n",
      "very far from looking well.”\n",
      "“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?” cried Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley, hearing his own name.\n",
      "“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\n",
      "well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\n",
      "wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\n",
      "you left home.”\n",
      "“My dear Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray do not concern yourself\n",
      "about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\n",
      "the children, and let me look as I chuse.”\n",
      "“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,”\n",
      "cried Emma, “about your friend Mr. Graham’s intending to have a bailiff\n",
      "from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\n",
      "not the old prejudice be too strong?”\n",
      "And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\n",
      "to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\n",
      "worse to hear than Isabella’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\n",
      "Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\n",
      "moment very happy to assist in praising.\n",
      "“That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!” said Mrs. John Knightley.—“It is so\n",
      "long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\n",
      "accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\n",
      "grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\n",
      "regret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at\n",
      "Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\n",
      "Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\n",
      "delightful companion for Emma.”\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\n",
      "“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\n",
      "kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\n",
      "better companion than Harriet.”\n",
      "“I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\n",
      "very accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma’s age.”\n",
      "This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\n",
      "moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\n",
      "close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\n",
      "a great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting\n",
      "decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\n",
      "Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\n",
      "tolerably;—but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\n",
      "had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\n",
      "her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\n",
      "had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\n",
      "gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\n",
      "it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\n",
      "dangerous opening.\n",
      "“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\n",
      "with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma’s ear expressed, “Ah!\n",
      "there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\n",
      "does not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would\n",
      "not talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\n",
      "him to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\n",
      "minutes, however, he began with,\n",
      "“I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\n",
      "instead of coming here.”\n",
      "“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a\n",
      "great deal of good.”\n",
      "“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\n",
      "to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\n",
      "hear you had fixed upon South End.”\n",
      "“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\n",
      "a mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\n",
      "the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\n",
      "entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\n",
      "be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\n",
      "and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.”\n",
      "“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—Perry\n",
      "was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\n",
      "sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\n",
      "by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\n",
      "the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have\n",
      "consulted Perry.”\n",
      "“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how\n",
      "great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”\n",
      "“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\n",
      "should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\n",
      "chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all,\n",
      "better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\n",
      "worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\n",
      "ill-judged measure.”\n",
      "Emma’s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\n",
      "reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\n",
      "brother-in-law’s breaking out.\n",
      "“Mr. Perry,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do\n",
      "as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\n",
      "any business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family to\n",
      "one part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\n",
      "my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more than\n",
      "his drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\n",
      "sarcastic dryness, “If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\n",
      "five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\n",
      "expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\n",
      "willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.”\n",
      "“True, true,” cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition—“very\n",
      "true. That’s a consideration indeed.—But John, as to what I was telling\n",
      "you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\n",
      "right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\n",
      "any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\n",
      "inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\n",
      "the present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\n",
      "will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\n",
      "morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\n",
      "your opinion.”\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\n",
      "friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\n",
      "attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing\n",
      "attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the\n",
      "immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\n",
      "other, prevented any renewal of it.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIII\n",
      "There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\n",
      "Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\n",
      "among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over\n",
      "what she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had\n",
      "nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.\n",
      "It was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being much too short.\n",
      "In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\n",
      "mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\n",
      "there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\n",
      "denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was\n",
      "persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\n",
      "the party.\n",
      "How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\n",
      "could, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually\n",
      "at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\n",
      "that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\n",
      "to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\n",
      "Harriet also.\n",
      "Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\n",
      "only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well\n",
      "as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination being\n",
      "consulted in every thing.\n",
      "The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\n",
      "by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\n",
      "a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma\n",
      "called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with\n",
      "regard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,\n",
      "and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which\n",
      "excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not\n",
      "speak of her loss without many tears.\n",
      "Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s\n",
      "unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\n",
      "Mr. Elton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at\n",
      "last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a\n",
      "most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had\n",
      "not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she was met by\n",
      "Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on\n",
      "slowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the\n",
      "rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he\n",
      "might carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr.\n",
      "John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two\n",
      "eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a\n",
      "country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton\n",
      "and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\n",
      "proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s\n",
      "complaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\n",
      "about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\n",
      "alarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\n",
      "he exclaimed,\n",
      "“A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\n",
      "infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\n",
      "yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\n",
      "Why does not Perry see her?”\n",
      "Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\n",
      "excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and\n",
      "care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\n",
      "could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\n",
      "than not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject,\n",
      "“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like\n",
      "snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\n",
      "should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from\n",
      "venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel\n",
      "the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\n",
      "great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\n",
      "Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\n",
      "a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\n",
      "what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\n",
      "common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\n",
      "which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\n",
      "care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her’s,\n",
      "he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma,\n",
      "too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear\n",
      "him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied\n",
      "with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly\n",
      "very cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from\n",
      "Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet\n",
      "every hour of the evening.\n",
      "“You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies to Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston.”\n",
      "But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\n",
      "offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s only\n",
      "objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\n",
      "satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\n",
      "his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\n",
      "never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\n",
      "he next looked at her.\n",
      "“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!—After I had got him\n",
      "off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\n",
      "behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many men,\n",
      "especially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining\n",
      "out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\n",
      "their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing\n",
      "gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\n",
      "valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in\n",
      "love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must\n",
      "dine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see\n",
      "ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”\n",
      "Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\n",
      "the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\n",
      "manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\n",
      "assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard’s for news of her fair\n",
      "friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\n",
      "her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he\n",
      "sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\n",
      "approbation much in his favour.\n",
      "After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\n",
      "began with—\n",
      "“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\n",
      "Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\n",
      "men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\n",
      "please, every feature works.”\n",
      "“Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there\n",
      "is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\n",
      "great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\n",
      "will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\n",
      "perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\n",
      "value.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems\n",
      "to have a great deal of good-will towards you.”\n",
      "“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me\n",
      "to be Mr. Elton’s object?”\n",
      "“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\n",
      "occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "“Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!”\n",
      "“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\n",
      "so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\n",
      "manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\n",
      "look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”\n",
      "“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\n",
      "are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing\n",
      "herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\n",
      "partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\n",
      "high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\n",
      "well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\n",
      "in want of counsel. He said no more.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\n",
      "spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\n",
      "shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\n",
      "eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\n",
      "of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\n",
      "own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\n",
      "was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\n",
      "severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\n",
      "of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\n",
      "being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\n",
      "white world in a very short time.\n",
      "Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\n",
      "preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\n",
      "his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\n",
      "which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\n",
      "nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\n",
      "whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\n",
      "discontent.\n",
      "“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when he\n",
      "asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\n",
      "this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\n",
      "agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\n",
      "absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing\n",
      "people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people’s not staying\n",
      "comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\n",
      "evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\n",
      "should deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\n",
      "than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\n",
      "the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\n",
      "or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\n",
      "that he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\n",
      "another man’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\n",
      "and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\n",
      "Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and\n",
      "four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\n",
      "creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\n",
      "at home.”\n",
      "Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\n",
      "doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my\n",
      "love,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling\n",
      "companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any\n",
      "answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\n",
      "quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\n",
      "talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\n",
      "her lips.\n",
      "They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.\n",
      "Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma\n",
      "thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all\n",
      "obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\n",
      "indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\n",
      "account of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while\n",
      "dressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—not better.”\n",
      "“_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard’s,” said she presently, “was not so\n",
      "pleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was _my_ answer.”\n",
      "His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\n",
      "sentiment as he answered.\n",
      "“Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that\n",
      "when I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing\n",
      "before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\n",
      "by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had\n",
      "flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew\n",
      "had been given her in the morning.”\n",
      "Emma smiled and answered—“My visit was of use to the nervous part of\n",
      "her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it\n",
      "is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\n",
      "probably heard.”\n",
      "“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”\n",
      "“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\n",
      "morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\n",
      "impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party\n",
      "to-day!”\n",
      "“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”\n",
      "This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\n",
      "estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\n",
      "when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\n",
      "and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\n",
      "“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for\n",
      "carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold\n",
      "with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\n",
      "rendered a gentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\n",
      "and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\n",
      "unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\n",
      "cold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!\n",
      "snows a little I see.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good deal of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable; and\n",
      "extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\n",
      "yesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly\n",
      "have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\n",
      "much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\n",
      "the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\n",
      "invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\n",
      "worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week.\n",
      "Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\n",
      "get away till that very day se’nnight.”\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\n",
      "said only, coolly,\n",
      "“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”\n",
      "At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\n",
      "astonished now at Mr. Elton’s spirits for other feelings. Harriet\n",
      "seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\n",
      "“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the\n",
      "greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs. Weston\n",
      "indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\n",
      "hospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where\n",
      "small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\n",
      "Mr. Weston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten\n",
      "comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,\n",
      "fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,\n",
      "(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your\n",
      "approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large\n",
      "parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”\n",
      "“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with\n",
      "any body.”\n",
      "“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\n",
      "been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be\n",
      "paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\n",
      "enjoyment.”\n",
      "“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed through\n",
      "the sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\n",
      "walked into Mrs. Weston’s drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose his\n",
      "joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton\n",
      "must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\n",
      "place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\n",
      "happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\n",
      "Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\n",
      "world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\n",
      "one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\n",
      "understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\n",
      "little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\n",
      "and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\n",
      "had not a lively concern; and half an hour’s uninterrupted\n",
      "communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\n",
      "of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n",
      "This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not\n",
      "afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\n",
      "the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\n",
      "grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\n",
      "Mr. Elton’s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\n",
      "that was enjoyable to the utmost.\n",
      "The misfortune of Harriet’s cold had been pretty well gone through\n",
      "before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to\n",
      "give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\n",
      "Isabella’s coming, and of Emma’s being to follow, and had indeed just\n",
      "got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\n",
      "daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\n",
      "almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\n",
      "and welcome her dear Emma.\n",
      "Emma’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\n",
      "sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\n",
      "to her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility\n",
      "towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\n",
      "was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\n",
      "solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\n",
      "him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\n",
      "suggestion of “Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\n",
      "possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\n",
      "Harriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for\n",
      "her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and\n",
      "so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\n",
      "drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\n",
      "like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\n",
      "good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\n",
      "Harriet’s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\n",
      "positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\n",
      "going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard\n",
      "enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his\n",
      "son; she heard the words “my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,” repeated\n",
      "several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much\n",
      "suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but\n",
      "before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past\n",
      "that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.\n",
      "Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma’s resolution of never\n",
      "marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\n",
      "thought—especially since his father’s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if\n",
      "she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\n",
      "character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\n",
      "families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\n",
      "match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\n",
      "meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\n",
      "situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\n",
      "change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\n",
      "intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\n",
      "degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\n",
      "their friends’ imaginations.\n",
      "With such sensations, Mr. Elton’s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\n",
      "but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\n",
      "cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\n",
      "pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\n",
      "substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for\n",
      "when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\n",
      "dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\n",
      "hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\n",
      "to her,\n",
      "“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\n",
      "see two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\n",
      "son—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\n",
      "hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting\n",
      "Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us\n",
      "within a fortnight.”\n",
      "Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\n",
      "his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\n",
      "party quite complete.\n",
      "“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since\n",
      "September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\n",
      "own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\n",
      "ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\n",
      "But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\n",
      "January.”\n",
      "“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\n",
      "anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\n",
      "She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\n",
      "know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is\n",
      "quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the\n",
      "other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)—The case is,\n",
      "that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\n",
      "January; and that Frank’s coming depends upon their being put off. If\n",
      "they are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\n",
      "is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\n",
      "a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\n",
      "them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\n",
      "to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\n",
      "confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\n",
      "being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\n",
      "upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\n",
      "little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\n",
      "effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.”\n",
      "“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied\n",
      "Emma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\n",
      "will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”\n",
      "“Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\n",
      "the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to\n",
      "speak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to be very\n",
      "fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any\n",
      "body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\n",
      "way—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\n",
      "to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\n",
      "that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it\n",
      "to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\n",
      "general; and the devil of a temper.”\n",
      "Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet\n",
      "observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.—\n",
      "Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\n",
      "secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\n",
      "of: “for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\n",
      "Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\n",
      "Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter\n",
      "stands?”\n",
      "“Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”\n",
      "“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the certainty of\n",
      "caprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\n",
      "before—“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\n",
      "so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\n",
      "thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure; in\n",
      "short, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture on the\n",
      "truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\n",
      "woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied\n",
      "Isabella: “and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\n",
      "the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\n",
      "person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any\n",
      "thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she\n",
      "never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\n",
      "have made them!”\n",
      "Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\n",
      "heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\n",
      "which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\n",
      "would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from\n",
      "her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\n",
      "imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\n",
      "present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\n",
      "followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,\n",
      "was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\n",
      "conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\n",
      "whom he was always comfortable.\n",
      "While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\n",
      "saying,\n",
      "“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\n",
      "certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\n",
      "whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”\n",
      "“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\n",
      "if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\n",
      "some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\n",
      "any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\n",
      "Churchills’ to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\n",
      "jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\n",
      "dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”\n",
      "“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a couple of days,\n",
      "he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having\n",
      "it in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\n",
      "into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\n",
      "wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_’s being under\n",
      "such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\n",
      "he likes it.”\n",
      "“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\n",
      "one decides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to\n",
      "use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\n",
      "individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\n",
      "not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\n",
      "every thing gives way to her.”\n",
      "“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\n",
      "Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\n",
      "that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\n",
      "whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\n",

      "she owes nothing at all.”\n",
      "“My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\n",
      "a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\n",
      "I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\n",
      "may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\n",
      "be.”\n",
      "Emma listened, and then coolly said, “I shall not be satisfied, unless\n",
      "he comes.”\n",
      "“He may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\n",
      "beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance\n",
      "of his coming away from them to visit us.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XV\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea\n",
      "he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\n",
      "companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\n",
      "the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty\n",
      "and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\n",
      "last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\n",
      "very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and\n",
      "Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\n",
      "with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\n",
      "Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\n",
      "expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\n",
      "improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\n",
      "making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\n",
      "friendly smiles.\n",
      "He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,\n",
      "lovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?—had she heard any thing about\n",
      "her, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must\n",
      "confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.” And\n",
      "in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\n",
      "attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\n",
      "terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\n",
      "But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\n",
      "he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\n",
      "on Harriet’s—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\n",
      "that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\n",
      "earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\n",
      "again, for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\n",
      "into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\n",
      "though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\n",
      "proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\n",
      "about her. She was vexed. It did appear—there was no concealing\n",
      "it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\n",
      "Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\n",
      "and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston to implore her assistance, “Would not she give him her\n",
      "support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard’s till it were certain that Miss\n",
      "Smith’s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\n",
      "promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?”\n",
      "“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for\n",
      "herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\n",
      "yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\n",
      "throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I\n",
      "some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”\n",
      "Emma saw Mrs. Weston’s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\n",
      "address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right\n",
      "of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked\n",
      "and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the\n",
      "purpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she\n",
      "thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,\n",
      "removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\n",
      "She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\n",
      "another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\n",
      "from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\n",
      "of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,\n",
      "with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse:\n",
      "“This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.\n",
      "Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\n",
      "through a storm of snow.”\n",
      "Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\n",
      "had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\n",
      "and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and\n",
      "Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\n",
      "son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\n",
      "“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out\n",
      "in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\n",
      "Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;\n",
      "and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two’s snow\n",
      "can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one\n",
      "is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the\n",
      "other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\n",
      "midnight.”\n",
      "Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\n",
      "had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\n",
      "should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\n",
      "hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\n",
      "to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\n",
      "they would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\n",
      "that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\n",
      "good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\n",
      "calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\n",
      "every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\n",
      "consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\n",
      "“What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?” was Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse’s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\n",
      "To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\n",
      "representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\n",
      "their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\n",
      "His eldest daughter’s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\n",
      "blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\n",
      "in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\n",
      "adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\n",
      "eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\n",
      "Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\n",
      "the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\n",
      "“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I\n",
      "dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\n",
      "we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\n",
      "all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\n",
      "shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\n",
      "that gives me cold.”\n",
      "“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\n",
      "extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\n",
      "does give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home,\n",
      "I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.”\n",
      "Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\n",
      "not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\n",
      "and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\n",
      "left the room immediately after his brother’s first report of the snow,\n",
      "came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\n",
      "examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\n",
      "in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\n",
      "hence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury\n",
      "road—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly\n",
      "enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\n",
      "but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\n",
      "being soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\n",
      "him in there being nothing to apprehend.\n",
      "To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\n",
      "scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father’s account, who was\n",
      "immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\n",
      "constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\n",
      "appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\n",
      "Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\n",
      "returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\n",
      "to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—\n",
      "“Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?”\n",
      "“I am ready, if the others are.”\n",
      "“Shall I ring the bell?”\n",
      "“Yes, do.”\n",
      "And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes\n",
      "more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his\n",
      "own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\n",
      "happiness when this visit of hardship were over.\n",
      "The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\n",
      "occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\n",
      "Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of\n",
      "alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\n",
      "discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. “He was\n",
      "afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\n",
      "would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\n",
      "He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\n",
      "as they could;” and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\n",
      "slow and wait for the other carriage.\n",
      "Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\n",
      "did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\n",
      "so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\n",
      "carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\n",
      "and that they were to have a tête-à-tête drive. It would not have been\n",
      "the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\n",
      "previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\n",
      "him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\n",
      "one. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\n",
      "been drinking too much of Mr. Weston’s good wine, and felt sure that he\n",
      "would want to be talking nonsense.\n",
      "To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\n",
      "immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\n",
      "the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\n",
      "they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\n",
      "found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and\n",
      "Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\n",
      "precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\n",
      "known, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but\n",
      "flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\n",
      "unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\n",
      "very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\n",
      "really was so. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent\n",
      "diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\n",
      "_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\n",
      "it all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\n",
      "restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\n",
      "be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\n",
      "the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\n",
      "playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\n",
      "replied,\n",
      "“I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\n",
      "yourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be\n",
      "happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.”\n",
      "“Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!”—And\n",
      "he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\n",
      "pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\n",
      "“Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\n",
      "for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\n",
      "either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\n",
      "to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.”\n",
      "But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\n",
      "all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\n",
      "having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\n",
      "slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but\n",
      "acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he\n",
      "resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\n",
      "favourable answer.\n",
      "As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\n",
      "inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\n",
      "replied,\n",
      "“It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\n",
      "too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\n",
      "express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\n",
      "month, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\n",
      "of observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness\n",
      "of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\n",
      "sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\n",
      "professions.”\n",
      "“Good Heaven!” cried Mr. Elton, “what can be the meaning of this?—Miss\n",
      "Smith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\n",
      "existence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\n",
      "cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\n",
      "fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\n",
      "sorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\n",
      "can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\n",
      "honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\n",
      "you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\n",
      "else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\n",
      "been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\n",
      "really, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be\n",
      "insinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me.”\n",
      "It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of\n",
      "all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\n",
      "overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\n",
      "being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton’s sanguine state of mind, he\n",
      "tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed—\n",
      "“Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\n",
      "silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.”\n",
      "“No, sir,” cried Emma, “it confesses no such thing. So far from having\n",
      "long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\n",
      "to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\n",
      "should have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther\n",
      "from my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of\n",
      "her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\n",
      "very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\n",
      "not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\n",
      "judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\n",
      "have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\n",
      "Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?”\n",
      "“Never, madam,” cried he, affronted in his turn: “never, I assure you.\n",
      "_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of\n",
      "girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\n",
      "extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\n",
      "to—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\n",
      "quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\n",
      "alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my\n",
      "visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\n",
      "I received—”\n",
      "“Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely\n",
      "mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\n",
      "friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\n",
      "acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\n",
      "ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\n",
      "have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\n",
      "probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\n",
      "are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\n",
      "trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\n",
      "present.”\n",
      "He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\n",
      "supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\n",
      "deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\n",
      "for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\n",
      "there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\n",
      "awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\n",
      "little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\n",
      "turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\n",
      "all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\n",
      "syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\n",
      "night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\n",
      "indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to\n",
      "Hartfield.\n",
      "There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had\n",
      "been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\n",
      "Lane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in\n",
      "strange hands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as\n",
      "if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\n",
      "John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\n",
      "attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\n",
      "father, as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\n",
      "gruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\n",
      "day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\n",
      "except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\n",
      "it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\n",
      "the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet\n",
      "reflection.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\n",
      "and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow\n",
      "of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every\n",
      "thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of\n",
      "all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\n",
      "other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\n",
      "would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in\n",
      "error—more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\n",
      "effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\n",
      "“If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\n",
      "any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me—but poor\n",
      "Harriet!”\n",
      "How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never\n",
      "thought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well as she\n",
      "could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\n",
      "supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\n",
      "have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\n",
      "misled.\n",
      "The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the\n",
      "charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had\n",
      "seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its “ready\n",
      "wit”—but then the “soft eyes”—in fact it suited neither; it was a\n",
      "jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\n",
      "thick-headed nonsense?\n",
      "Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\n",

      "that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\n",

      "till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\n",
      "any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet’s friend.\n",
      "To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\n",
      "subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\n",
      "that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\n",
      "had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\n",
      "conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\n",
      "indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\n",
      "character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\n",
      "dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\n",
      "respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\n",
      "proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\n",
      "concerned about the feelings of others.\n",
      "Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton’s wanting to pay his\n",
      "addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\n",
      "proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\n",
      "and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\n",
      "arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\n",
      "was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\n",
      "be cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\n",
      "or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\n",
      "could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\n",
      "less allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\n",
      "He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\n",
      "easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\n",
      "else with twenty, or with ten.\n",
      "But—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\n",
      "of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\n",
      "him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down\n",
      "upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\n",
      "him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\n",
      "presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking.\n",
      "Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\n",
      "inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\n",
      "such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\n",
      "in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\n",
      "that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\n",
      "Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the\n",
      "Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\n",
      "inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\n",
      "to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\n",
      "other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\n",
      "Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\n",
      "had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\n",
      "which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\n",
      "he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\n",
      "him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied\n",
      "her in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\n",
      "after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\n",
      "and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\n",
      "admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\n",
      "obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\n",
      "motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\n",
      "delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\n",
      "If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\n",
      "wonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\n",
      "hers.\n",
      "The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\n",
      "wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\n",
      "was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\n",
      "to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\n",
      "concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\n",
      "“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into being very\n",
      "much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\n",
      "me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\n",
      "not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\n",
      "used to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\n",
      "not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\n",
      "of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\n",
      "chance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\n",
      "opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\n",
      "attempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\n",
      "I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\n",
      "this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\n",
      "body else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I\n",
      "could not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer.”\n",
      "She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\n",
      "more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\n",
      "be, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\n",
      "Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\n",
      "awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\n",
      "discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\n",
      "resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\n",
      "unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\n",
      "with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\n",
      "dreadfully.\n",
      "To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma’s, though under temporary\n",
      "gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\n",
      "spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\n",
      "and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\n",
      "to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\n",
      "softened pain and brighter hope.\n",
      "Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\n",
      "to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\n",
      "depend on getting tolerably out of it.\n",
      "It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love\n",
      "with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\n",
      "disappoint him—that Harriet’s nature should not be of that superior\n",
      "sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there\n",
      "could be no necessity for any body’s knowing what had passed except the\n",
      "three principals, and especially for her father’s being given a\n",
      "moment’s uneasiness about it.\n",
      "These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of\n",
      "snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome\n",
      "that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\n",
      "The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\n",
      "could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\n",
      "daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\n",
      "or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\n",
      "with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\n",
      "thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\n",
      "morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\n",
      "freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No\n",
      "intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\n",
      "Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\n",
      "Mr. Elton’s absenting himself.\n",
      "It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\n",
      "though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\n",
      "society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well\n",
      "satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\n",
      "out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\n",
      "entirely from them,—\n",
      "“Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?”\n",
      "These days of confinement would have been, but for her private\n",
      "perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\n",
      "her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\n",
      "companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\n",
      "ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\n",
      "the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\n",
      "obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes\n",
      "of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still\n",
      "such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,\n",
      "as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVII\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\n",
      "weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\n",
      "behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set\n",
      "off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\n",
      "Isabella;—which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\n",
      "on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\n",
      "busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\n",
      "The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\n",
      "Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\n",
      "Mr. Elton’s best compliments, “that he was proposing to leave Highbury\n",
      "the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the\n",
      "pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\n",
      "weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\n",
      "various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\n",
      "leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\n",
      "retain a grateful sense—and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\n",
      "happy to attend to them.”\n",
      "Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr. Elton’s absence just at this\n",
      "time was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\n",
      "it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\n",
      "was announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\n",
      "in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\n",
      "She had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not\n",
      "mentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\n",
      "ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,\n",
      "as she thought, at first, could not escape her father’s suspicion.\n",
      "It did, however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\n",
      "sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely\n",
      "to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was\n",
      "a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\n",
      "and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\n",
      "with all her usual promptitude.\n",
      "She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\n",
      "to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable\n",
      "that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\n",
      "her other complaint before the gentleman’s return. She went to Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\n",
      "penance of communication; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy\n",
      "all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in\n",
      "the ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself\n",
      "grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\n",
      "her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\n",
      "six weeks.\n",
      "The confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of\n",
      "Harriet’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\n",
      "herself again.\n",
      "Harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every\n",
      "thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\n",
      "of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\n",
      "her friend.\n",
      "Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\n",
      "and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\n",
      "Harriet’s side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\n",
      "any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\n",
      "would have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved\n",
      "him—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\n",
      "have thought it possible.\n",
      "Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no\n",
      "dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she\n",
      "listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\n",
      "understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\n",
      "superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for\n",
      "her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence\n",
      "could do.\n",
      "It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\n",
      "ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\n",
      "being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\n",
      "her life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father’s claims,\n",
      "was to promote Harriet’s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own\n",
      "affection in some better method than by match-making. She got her to\n",
      "Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to\n",
      "occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton\n",
      "from her thoughts.\n",
      "Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she\n",
      "could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\n",
      "general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.\n",
      "Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet’s\n",
      "age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might\n",
      "be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton’s return,\n",
      "as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of\n",
      "acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing\n",
      "them.\n",
      "Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\n",
      "of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did, in truth, prove\n",
      "herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it\n",
      "appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\n",
      "inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend\n",
      "its continuing very long in equal force.\n",
      "If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\n",
      "indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\n",
      "imagine Harriet’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\n",
      "recollection of him.\n",
      "Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\n",
      "each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\n",
      "effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\n",
      "other, and make the best of it.\n",
      "Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\n",
      "girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\n",
      "have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\n",
      "repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\n",
      "found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\n",
      "cure, there could be no true peace for herself.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVIII\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of\n",
      "excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his “very great\n",
      "mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of\n",
      "coming to Randalls at no distant period.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in\n",
      "fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\n",
      "had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\n",
      "expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\n",
      "any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\n",
      "and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\n",
      "sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank’s coming two or three\n",
      "months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better\n",
      "weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\n",
      "considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\n",
      "These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a\n",
      "more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\n",
      "excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\n",
      "to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\n",
      "Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at\n",
      "Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,\n",
      "rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was\n",
      "desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she\n",
      "took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as\n",
      "warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston’s disappointment, as might naturally\n",
      "belong to their friendship.\n",
      "She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\n",
      "as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\n",
      "more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\n",
      "proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\n",
      "such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\n",
      "looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\n",
      "sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\n",
      "Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\n",
      "with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\n",
      "taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\n",
      "use of Mrs. Weston’s arguments against herself.\n",
      "“The Churchills are very likely in fault,” said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\n",
      "“but I dare say he might come if he would.”\n",
      "“I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\n",
      "but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”\n",
      "“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\n",
      "point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”\n",
      "“How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\n",
      "suppose him such an unnatural creature?”\n",
      "“I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\n",
      "that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\n",
      "little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\n",
      "have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural\n",
      "than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\n",
      "proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\n",
      "too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\n",
      "contrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is\n",
      "he?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as\n",
      "much as that. It is impossible.”\n",
      "“That’s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\n",
      "own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\n",
      "difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\n",
      "to manage.”\n",
      "“It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\n",
      "should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\n",
      "money—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\n",
      "much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\n",
      "in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\n",
      "other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\n",
      "leave the Churchills.”\n",
      "“Yes, sometimes he can.”\n",
      "“And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\n",
      "there is any temptation of pleasure.”\n",
      "“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate\n",
      "knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\n",
      "of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\n",
      "family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill’s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\n",
      "can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\n",
      "at others.”\n",
      "“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\n",
      "that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\n",
      "resolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his\n",
      "father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\n",
      "wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\n",
      "once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of mere\n",
      "pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\n",
      "I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\n",
      "failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\n",
      "shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—If he would say so to her at\n",
      "once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\n",
      "opposition made to his going.”\n",
      "“No,” said Emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some made to his\n",
      "coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\n",
      "use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\n",
      "have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\n",
      "to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\n",
      "the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\n",
      "him!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\n",
      "loud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?”\n",
      "“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\n",
      "He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of\n",
      "course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do\n",
      "him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\n",
      "people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\n",
      "can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\n",
      "they could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\n",
      "father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\n",
      "well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\n",
      "father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\n",
      "hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\n",
      "Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\n",
      "this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\n",
      "little minds would bend to his.”\n",
      "“I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\n",
      "where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\n",
      "have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\n",
      "great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\n",
      "to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill’s\n",
      "situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\n",
      "recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\n",
      "Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\n",
      "have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\n",
      "To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\n",
      "perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\n",
      "regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\n",
      "as you can have, without being so equal, under particular\n",
      "circumstances, to act up to it.”\n",
      "“Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\n",
      "exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.”\n",
      "“Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\n",
      "understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\n",
      "opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\n",
      "life.”\n",
      "“Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\n",
      "occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\n",
      "will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\n",
      "following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\n",
      "the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\n",
      "ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\n",
      "their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\n",
      "side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\n",
      "would have been no difficulty now.”\n",
      "“We shall never agree about him,” cried Emma; “but that is nothing\n",
      "extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\n",
      "I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\n",
      "though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\n",
      "complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man’s\n",
      "perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\n",
      "advantages, it will secure him many others.”\n",
      "“Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\n",
      "leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\n",
      "expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\n",
      "flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\n",
      "himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\n",
      "preserving peace at home and preventing his father’s having any right\n",
      "to complain. His letters disgust me.”\n",
      "“Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.”\n",
      "“I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\n",
      "woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s\n",
      "place, but without a mother’s affection to blind her. It is on her\n",
      "account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\n",
      "feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\n",
      "would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\n",
      "did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\n",
      "considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\n",
      "herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\n",
      "French, not in English. He may be very ‘amiable,’ have very good\n",
      "manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy\n",
      "towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "“You seem determined to think ill of him.”\n",
      "“Me!—not at all,” replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; “I do not\n",
      "want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\n",
      "merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\n",
      "personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\n",
      "plausible manners.”\n",
      "“Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\n",
      "at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\n",
      "agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\n",
      "bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\n",
      "coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\n",
      "parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—one object of\n",
      "curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\n",
      "of nobody else.”\n",
      "“You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\n",
      "conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\n",
      "chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”\n",
      "“My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\n",
      "every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\n",
      "agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\n",
      "and so on to every body, having that general information on all\n",
      "subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\n",
      "just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\n",
      "that is my idea of him.”\n",
      "“And mine,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “is, that if he turn out any\n",
      "thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\n",
      "at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the\n",
      "practised politician, who is to read every body’s character, and make\n",
      "every body’s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\n",
      "be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\n",
      "fools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\n",
      "not endure such a puppy when it came to the point.”\n",
      "“I will say no more about him,” cried Emma, “you turn every thing to\n",
      "evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\n",
      "chance of agreeing till he is really here.”\n",
      "“Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.”\n",
      "“But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love\n",
      "for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.”\n",
      "“He is a person I never think of from one month’s end to another,” said\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\n",
      "talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should\n",
      "be angry.\n",
      "To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\n",
      "different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\n",
      "mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\n",
      "high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she\n",
      "had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the\n",
      "merit of another.\n",
      "VOLUME II\n",
      "CHAPTER I\n",
      "Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma’s\n",
      "opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\n",
      "not think that Harriet’s solace or her own sins required more; and she\n",
      "was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\n",
      "returned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\n",
      "and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,\n",
      "and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr. Elton is so\n",
      "good to the poor!” she found something else must be done.\n",
      "They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\n",
      "She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\n",
      "always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\n",
      "loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\n",
      "who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\n",
      "that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\n",
      "their scanty comforts.\n",
      "She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\n",
      "as to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\n",
      "of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and all\n",
      "the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\n",
      "third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and\n",
      "therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden\n",
      "resolution of not passing their door without going in—observing, as she\n",
      "proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were\n",
      "just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\n",
      "The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\n",
      "the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized\n",
      "apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most\n",
      "cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who\n",
      "with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to\n",
      "give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking\n",
      "daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks\n",
      "for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her mother’s, and\n",
      "sweet-cake from the beaufet—“Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called\n",
      "in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them,\n",
      "and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she\n",
      "liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss\n",
      "Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.”\n",
      "The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\n",
      "There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\n",
      "since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\n",
      "letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\n",
      "he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he\n",
      "went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies’ ball had been; and she\n",
      "went through it very well, with all the interest and all the\n",
      "commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to\n",
      "prevent Harriet’s being obliged to say a word.\n",
      "This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\n",
      "having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\n",
      "any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the\n",
      "Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not\n",
      "been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was\n",
      "actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last\n",
      "abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\n",
      "“Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing—Mrs. Cole was\n",
      "telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was—Mrs. Cole was so kind\n",
      "as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came\n",
      "in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite\n",
      "there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her\n",
      "kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any\n",
      "body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, ‘I\n",
      "know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\n",
      "for writing;’ and when I immediately said, ‘But indeed we have, we had\n",
      "a letter this very morning,’ I do not know that I ever saw any body\n",
      "more surprized. ‘Have you, upon your honour?’ said she; ‘well, that is\n",
      "quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.’”\n",
      "Emma’s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest—\n",
      "“Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\n",
      "hope she is well?”\n",
      "“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt, while\n",
      "eagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\n",
      "not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without\n",
      "being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very\n",
      "lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it\n",
      "to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my\n",
      "mother, for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she\n",
      "can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and\n",
      "here it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to\n",
      "wish to hear what she says;—but, first of all, I really must, in\n",
      "justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two\n",
      "pages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and\n",
      "crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\n",
      "She often says, when the letter is first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I\n",
      "think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’—don’t\n",
      "you, ma’am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make\n",
      "it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I\n",
      "am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,\n",
      "indeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can\n",
      "see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is\n",
      "such a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often\n",
      "says, when she is here, ‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very\n",
      "strong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done\n",
      "too!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’”\n",
      "All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\n",
      "and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax’s handwriting.\n",
      "“You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; “you\n",
      "who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure\n",
      "there is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.\n",
      "Ma’am,” addressing her, “do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging\n",
      "to say about Jane’s handwriting?”\n",
      "And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\n",
      "twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\n",
      "pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\n",
      "rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax’s letter, and had almost\n",
      "resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\n",
      "Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.\n",
      "“My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all. By\n",
      "only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\n",
      "she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\n",
      "remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\n",
      "Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at\n",
      "all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at\n",
      "my mother’s time of life—and it really is full two years, you know,\n",
      "since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,\n",
      "and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough\n",
      "of her now.”\n",
      "“Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?”\n",
      "“Oh yes; next week.”\n",
      "“Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure.”\n",
      "“Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\n",
      "surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\n",
      "will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\n",
      "her. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\n",
      "Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So\n",
      "very good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you\n",
      "know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.\n",
      "That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in\n",
      "the common course, we should not have heard from her before next\n",
      "Tuesday or Wednesday.”\n",
      "“Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\n",
      "hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.”\n",
      "“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\n",
      "for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\n",
      "mother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least.\n",
      "Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\n",
      "pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells\n",
      "are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to\n",
      "come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till\n",
      "the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she\n",
      "married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,\n",
      "which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was\n",
      "going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very\n",
      "urgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know\n",
      "which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr.\n",
      "Dixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\n",
      "and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to\n",
      "their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has\n",
      "heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know\n",
      "that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very\n",
      "natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while\n",
      "he was paying his addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking\n",
      "out with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about\n",
      "their daughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I\n",
      "do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be\n",
      "telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she\n",
      "wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views\n",
      "that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I\n",
      "believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of\n",
      "things.”\n",
      "At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma’s\n",
      "brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not\n",
      "going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\n",
      "discovery,\n",
      "“You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\n",
      "come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\n",
      "between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\n",
      "excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\n",
      "“Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\n",
      "rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\n",
      "distance from us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was\n",
      "to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\n",
      "her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\n",
      "Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\n",
      "than their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\n",
      "Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a\n",
      "most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\n",
      "Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by\n",
      "the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would\n",
      "have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone,\n",
      "if he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her\n",
      "habit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we\n",
      "had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!”\n",

      "Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?”\n",
      "“Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and\n",
      "Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\n",
      "recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\n",

      "“I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\n",
      "Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no\n",
      "remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\n",
      "compared with Miss Fairfax.”\n",
      "“Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not.\n",
      "There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was\n",
      "absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable.”\n",

      "since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never\n",
      "mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\n",
      "considerate!—But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\n",
      "friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\n",
      "that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\n",
      "months at Highbury will entirely cure her—and it is certainly a great\n",
      "deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\n",

      "looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\n",
      "me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through\n",
      "to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\n",
      "fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\n",

      "but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\n",
      "burst out, quite frightened, with ‘Bless me! poor Jane is ill!’—which\n",
      "my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\n",
      "at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\n",
      "fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\n",
      "not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\n",
      "guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\n",
      "expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\n",
      "fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\n",
      "attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife\n",
      "and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well,\n",
      "now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will\n",
      "turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal\n",
      "better than I can tell it for her.”\n",

      "when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\n",
      "pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\n",
      "pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\n",

      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates’s youngest\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and Miss\n",
      "Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest;\n",
      "but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him\n",
      "dying in action abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief\n",
      "soon afterwards—and this girl.\n",
      "By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\n",
      "losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the\n",
      "consolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\n",
      "seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her\n",
      "being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up\n",
      "with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\n",
      "nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\n",
      "warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\n",
      "But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\n",
      "to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\n",
      "Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\n",
      "farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\n",
      "camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\n",
      "he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\n",
      "death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing\n",
      "in his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took\n",
      "notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a\n",
      "girl, about Jane’s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long\n",
      "visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years\n",
      "old, his daughter’s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a\n",
      "real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of\n",
      "undertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and\n",
      "from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell’s family, and\n",
      "had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time\n",
      "to time.\n",
      "The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\n",
      "very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\n",
      "independence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of\n",
      "Colonel Campbell’s power; for though his income, by pay and\n",
      "appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\n",
      "his daughter’s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\n",
      "supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\n",
      "Such was Jane Fairfax’s history. She had fallen into good hands, known\n",
      "nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\n",
      "education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed\n",
      "people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of\n",
      "discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell’s residence being in\n",
      "London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the\n",
      "attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were\n",
      "equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or\n",
      "nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\n",
      "care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\n",
      "but she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor\n",
      "mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil\n",
      "day was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\n",
      "and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\n",
      "rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of\n",
      "home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\n",
      "suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this\n",
      "might soon be over.\n",
      "The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell\n",
      "in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the\n",
      "circumstance of Jane’s decided superiority both in beauty and\n",
      "acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\n",
      "by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by\n",
      "the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till\n",
      "the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so\n",
      "often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to\n",
      "what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\n",
      "affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\n",
      "soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\n",
      "while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\n",
      "This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\n",
      "yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\n",
      "of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\n",
      "fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\n",
      "should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\n",
      "had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\n",
      "from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,\n",
      "peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\n",
      "The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\n",
      "resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\n",
      "exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\n",
      "for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\n",
      "would be selfishness:—what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps\n",
      "they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted\n",
      "the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such\n",
      "enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,\n",
      "however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not\n",
      "hurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since\n",
      "the time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have\n",
      "completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\n",
      "in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\n",
      "and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\n",
      "to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\n",
      "discharged with tolerable comfort.\n",
      "With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\n",
      "aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not\n",
      "told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\n",
      "Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\n",
      "those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\n",
      "whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\n",
      "or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\n",
      "they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\n",
      "recovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she\n",
      "was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\n",
      "novelty which had been so long promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must put\n",
      "up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\n",
      "freshness of a two years’ absence.\n",
      "Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\n",
      "through three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and\n",
      "less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\n",
      "difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\n",
      "because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\n",
      "wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\n",
      "eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\n",
      "which her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never\n",
      "get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\n",
      "such coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she\n",
      "pleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she\n",
      "was made such a fuss with by every body!—and it had been always\n",
      "imagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the\n",
      "same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.”\n",
      "These were her reasons—she had no better.\n",
      "It was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by\n",
      "fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\n",
      "considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\n",
      "now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years’\n",
      "interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\n",
      "manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\n",
      "Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\n",
      "the highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as\n",
      "almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\n",
      "her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\n",
      "between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\n",
      "to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\n",
      "this; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them\n",
      "altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\n",
      "pleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\n",
      "eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\n",
      "had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\n",
      "delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,\n",
      "of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in\n",
      "honour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance, which, whether of\n",
      "person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be\n",
      "vulgar, was distinction, and merit.\n",
      "In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\n",
      "twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\n",
      "justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\n",
      "she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\n",
      "when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she\n",
      "was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\n",
      "to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\n",
      "well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\n",
      "probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so\n",
      "naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\n",
      "pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\n",
      "Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon’s\n",
      "affections from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her\n",
      "imagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be\n",
      "simple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been\n",
      "unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\n",
      "conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\n",
      "might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\n",
      "divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\n",
      "beginning her career of laborious duty.\n",
      "Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\n",
      "as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\n",
      "afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that\n",
      "she could wish to scheme about for her.\n",
      "These were charming feelings—but not lasting. Before she had committed\n",
      "herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane\n",
      "Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\n",
      "errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she\n",
      "is better than handsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\n",
      "her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\n",
      "usual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome\n",
      "as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\n",
      "admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\n",
      "exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\n",
      "small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\n",
      "new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane’s\n",
      "offences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\n",
      "thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\n",
      "affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\n",
      "in higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,\n",
      "which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\n",
      "at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\n",
      "determined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\n",
      "reserved.\n",
      "If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved\n",
      "on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed\n",
      "bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon’s character, or her own\n",
      "value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It\n",
      "was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or\n",
      "distinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown\n",
      "away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There\n",
      "probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr.\n",
      "Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other,\n",
      "or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve\n",
      "thousand pounds.\n",
      "The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\n",
      "little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\n",
      "procure as to what he truly was. “Was he handsome?”—“She believed he\n",
      "was reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he agreeable?”—“He was\n",
      "generally thought so.” “Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man\n",
      "of information?”—“At a watering-place, or in a common London\n",
      "acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\n",
      "all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\n",
      "they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\n",
      "manners pleasing.” Emma could not forgive her.\n",
      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "Emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment\n",
      "were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\n",
      "seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\n",
      "expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\n",
      "have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain\n",
      "enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her\n",
      "unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\n",
      "“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\n",
      "talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\n",
      "swept away;—“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\n",
      "very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than\n",
      "sitting at one’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such\n",
      "young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am\n",
      "sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left\n",
      "nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no\n",
      "instrument at her grandmother’s, it must have been a real indulgence.”\n",
      "“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I am not\n",
      "often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”\n",
      "“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “_that_ I am sure you are\n",
      "not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any\n",
      "thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been\n",
      "handed round once, I think it would have been enough.”\n",
      "“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are not often\n",
      "deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\n",
      "think you understand me, therefore.”\n",
      "An arch look expressed—“I understand you well enough;” but she said\n",
      "only, “Miss Fairfax is reserved.”\n",
      "“I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all\n",
      "that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\n",
      "foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be\n",
      "honoured.”\n",
      "“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”\n",
      "“My dear Emma,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\n",
      "“you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\n",
      "evening.”\n",
      "“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\n",
      "and amused to think how little information I obtained.”\n",
      "“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.\n",
      "“I hope every body had a pleasant evening,” said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\n",
      "quiet way. “I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\n",
      "moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\n",
      "Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\n",
      "she speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\n",
      "Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\n",
      "Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very\n",
      "well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\n",
      "agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.”\n",
      "“True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.”\n",
      "Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\n",
      "present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question—\n",
      "“She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one’s eyes\n",
      "from. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\n",
      "express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\n",
      "thoughts were on the Bates’s, said—\n",
      "“It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\n",
      "great pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so little one can\n",
      "venture to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon—Now we\n",
      "have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\n",
      "it is very small and delicate—Hartfield pork is not like any other\n",
      "pork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\n",
      "of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,\n",
      "without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear\n",
      "roast pork—I think we had better send the leg—do not you think so, my\n",
      "dear?”\n",
      "“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\n",
      "There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\n",
      "and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.”\n",
      "“That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\n",
      "that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\n",
      "is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\n",
      "boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\n",
      "little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”\n",
      "“Emma,” said Mr. Knightley presently, “I have a piece of news for you.\n",
      "You like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\n",
      "interest you.”\n",
      "“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile\n",
      "so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?”\n",
      "He had time only to say,\n",
      "“No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,” when the door was\n",
      "thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\n",
      "of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give\n",
      "quickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that\n",
      "not another syllable of communication could rest with him.\n",
      "“Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse—I\n",
      "come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are\n",
      "too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\n",
      "married.”\n",
      "Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\n",
      "completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\n",
      "little blush, at the sound.\n",
      "“There is my news:—I thought it would interest you,” said Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\n",
      "had passed between them.\n",
      "“But where could _you_ hear it?” cried Miss Bates. “Where could you\n",
      "possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\n",
      "received Mrs. Cole’s note—no, it cannot be more than five—or at least\n",
      "ten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out—I\n",
      "was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork—Jane was\n",
      "standing in the passage—were not you, Jane?—for my mother was so afraid\n",
      "that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down\n",
      "and see, and Jane said, ‘Shall I go down instead? for I think you have\n",
      "a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.’—‘Oh! my dear,’\n",
      "said I—well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins—that’s all I\n",
      "know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you\n",
      "possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of\n",
      "it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—”\n",
      "“I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\n",
      "read Elton’s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.”\n",
      "“Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news more\n",
      "generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\n",
      "mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\n",
      "thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.”\n",
      "“We consider our Hartfield pork,” replied Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed it\n",
      "certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\n",
      "cannot have a greater pleasure than—”\n",
      "“Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to\n",
      "us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\n",
      "themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We\n",
      "may well say that ‘our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.’ Well, Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well—”\n",
      "“It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of course.”—\n",
      "Here was a sly glance at Emma. “He had been so fortunate as to—I forget\n",
      "the precise words—one has no business to remember them. The information\n",
      "was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins.\n",
      "By his style, I should imagine it just settled.”\n",
      "“Mr. Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\n",
      "“He will have every body’s wishes for his happiness.”\n",
      "“He is very young to settle,” was Mr. Woodhouse’s observation. “He had\n",
      "better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\n",
      "were always glad to see him at Hartfield.”\n",
      "“A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!” said Miss Bates,\n",
      "joyfully; “my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to have\n",
      "the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.\n",
      "Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a\n",
      "curiosity to see him.”\n",
      "Jane’s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\n",
      "occupy her.\n",
      "“No—I have never seen Mr. Elton,” she replied, starting on this appeal;\n",
      "“is he—is he a tall man?”\n",
      "“Who shall answer that question?” cried Emma. “My father would say\n",
      "‘yes,’ Mr. Knightley ‘no;’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\n",
      "happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\n",
      "you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\n",
      "Highbury, both in person and mind.”\n",
      "“Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\n",
      "man—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was\n",
      "precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say, an\n",
      "excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother—wanting her\n",
      "to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\n",
      "mother is a little deaf, you know—it is not much, but she does not hear\n",
      "quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\n",
      "fancied bathing might be good for it—the warm bath—but she says it did\n",
      "him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\n",
      "And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\n",
      "is such a happiness when good people get together—and they always do.\n",
      "Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\n",
      "such very good people; and the Perrys—I suppose there never was a\n",
      "happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,”\n",
      "turning to Mr. Woodhouse, “I think there are few places with such\n",
      "society as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our\n",
      "neighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better\n",
      "than another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—”\n",
      "“As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\n",
      "with her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that\n",
      "it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four\n",
      "weeks.”\n",
      "Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\n",
      "Emma said,\n",
      "“You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an interest\n",
      "in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on\n",
      "these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\n",
      "Campbell’s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\n",
      "Elton and Miss Hawkins.”\n",
      "“When I have seen Mr. Elton,” replied Jane, “I dare say I shall be\n",
      "interested—but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\n",
      "months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\n",
      "off.”\n",
      "“Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse,” said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.—A Miss\n",
      "Hawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady\n",
      "hereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but I\n",
      "immediately said, ‘No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man—but’—In\n",
      "short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of\n",
      "discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the\n",
      "same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired—Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\n",
      "offend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered\n",
      "now. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear\n",
      "little children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr.\n",
      "John Knightley. I mean in person—tall, and with that sort of look—and\n",
      "not very talkative.”\n",
      "“Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”\n",
      "“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\n",
      "One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\n",
      "not, strictly speaking, handsome?”\n",
      "“Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was\n",
      "plain.”\n",
      "“My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\n",
      "and that you yourself—”\n",
      "“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I\n",
      "always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\n",
      "general opinion, when I called him plain.”\n",
      "“Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather\n",
      "does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging,\n",
      "my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a\n",
      "most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs.\n",
      "Cole’s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better\n",
      "go home directly—I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is\n",
      "the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\n",
      "attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares\n",
      "for any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be\n",
      "another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is\n",
      "coming too. Well, that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired, you will\n",
      "be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!—Good\n",
      "morning to you.”\n",
      "Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\n",
      "he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to\n",
      "marry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view\n",
      "of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\n",
      "of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but\n",
      "she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that she could\n",
      "hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from\n",
      "hearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was\n",
      "likely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its\n",
      "beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\n",
      "detaining her at Mrs. Goddard’s, and that the intelligence would\n",
      "undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\n",
      "The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\n",
      "when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\n",
      "hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “Oh!\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!” which instantly burst\n",
      "forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow\n",
      "was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than\n",
      "in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had\n",
      "to tell. “She had set out from Mrs. Goddard’s half an hour ago—she had\n",
      "been afraid it would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every\n",
      "moment—but she thought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried\n",
      "on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where\n",
      "a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just\n",
      "step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\n",
      "half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she\n",
      "did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could,\n",
      "and took shelter at Ford’s.”—Ford’s was the principal woollen-draper,\n",
      "linen-draper, and haberdasher’s shop united; the shop first in size and\n",
      "fashion in the place.—“And so, there she had set, without an idea of\n",
      "any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps—when, all of a\n",
      "sudden, who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd!—but they\n",
      "always dealt at Ford’s—who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her\n",
      "brother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have\n",
      "fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the\n",
      "door—Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the\n",
      "umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\n",
      "no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and\n",
      "I kept sitting near the door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I\n",
      "must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,\n",
      "because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but\n",
      "there.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at last, I fancy, he looked round\n",
      "and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began\n",
      "whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I\n",
      "could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do\n",
      "you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward—came\n",
      "quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake\n",
      "hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she\n",
      "used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to\n",
      "be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but\n",
      "I know no more what I said—I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said\n",
      "she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was\n",
      "beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me\n",
      "from getting away—and then—only think!—I found he was coming up towards\n",
      "me too—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\n",
      "so he came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling\n",
      "dreadfully, you know, one can’t tell how; and then I took courage, and\n",
      "said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not\n",
      "got three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I\n",
      "was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.\n",
      "Cole’s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this\n",
      "rain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I\n",
      "said, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and\n",
      "then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables—I\n",
      "believe I did—but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh!\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and\n",
      "yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so\n",
      "pleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do\n",
      "talk to me and make me comfortable again.”\n",
      "Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\n",
      "her power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\n",
      "comfortable herself. The young man’s conduct, and his sister’s, seemed\n",
      "the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\n",
      "described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded\n",
      "affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed\n",
      "them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did\n",
      "this make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed\n",
      "by it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry.\n",
      "Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all\n",
      "have hoped to rise by Harriet’s acquaintance: and besides, what was the\n",
      "value of Harriet’s description?—So easily pleased—so little\n",
      "discerning;—what signified her praise?\n",
      "She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by\n",
      "considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of\n",
      "being dwelt on,\n",
      "“It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you seem to\n",
      "have behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may never—can never, as\n",
      "a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "Harriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about it;” but\n",
      "still she talked of it—still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma,\n",
      "at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to\n",
      "hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender\n",
      "caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed\n",
      "or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet—such a\n",
      "conclusion of Mr. Elton’s importance with her!\n",
      "Mr. Elton’s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\n",
      "the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an\n",
      "hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first\n",
      "conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations\n",
      "of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this\n",
      "fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under\n",
      "proper subordination in her fancy.\n",
      "Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\n",
      "had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining\n",
      "any influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\n",
      "at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\n",
      "courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\n",
      "brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard’s; and a\n",
      "twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with\n",
      "any necessity, or even any power of speech.\n",
      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\n",
      "situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\n",
      "being kindly spoken of.\n",
      "A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins’s name was first mentioned in\n",
      "Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\n",
      "every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant,\n",
      "highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself\n",
      "arrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of\n",
      "her merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her\n",
      "Christian name, and say whose music she principally played.\n",
      "Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\n",
      "mortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\n",
      "appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\n",
      "lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\n",
      "had gone away deeply offended—he came back engaged to another—and to\n",
      "another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\n",
      "circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back\n",
      "gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\n",
      "The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\n",
      "of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent\n",
      "fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of\n",
      "some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had\n",
      "not thrown himself away—he had gained a woman of 10,000 _l_. or\n",
      "thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity—the\n",

      "intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, that vanity and\n",
      "prudence were equally contented.\n",

      "gallant.\n",
      "The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\n",
      "please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\n",
      "when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\n",
      "a certain glance of Mrs. Cole’s did not seem to contradict, that when\n",
      "he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\n",
      "During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\n",
      "enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the\n",
      "impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and\n",
      "pretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very\n",
      "much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his\n",
      "sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable\n",
      "feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a\n",
      "source of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been\n",
      "thankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very\n",
      "well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would\n",
      "administer most satisfaction.\n",
      "The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\n",
      "certainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\n",
      "prevented—many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be\n",
      "an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\n",
      "without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good\n",
      "enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for\n",
      "Highbury—handsome enough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet’s side. As\n",
      "to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all\n",
      "his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On\n",
      "that article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be\n",
      "uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the\n",
      "10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet’s superior.\n",
      "She brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the\n",
      "youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol—merchant, of course, he must\n",
      "be called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life\n",
      "appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of\n",
      "his line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she\n",
      "had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very\n",
      "heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years\n",
      "ago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly\n",
      "honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and\n",
      "with him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of\n",
      "some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the\n",
      "connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_\n",
      "_married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept\n",
      "two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory\n",
      "of Miss Hawkins.\n",
      "Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\n",
      "talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\n",
      "of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet’s\n",
      "mind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\n",
      "certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\n",
      "would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\n",
      "her. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\n",
      "in love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\n",
      "reappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\n",
      "somewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times\n",
      "every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss\n",
      "him, _just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have\n",
      "something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring\n",
      "warmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually\n",
      "hearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always\n",
      "among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so\n",
      "interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,\n",
      "therefore, every guess—all that had already occurred, all that might\n",
      "occur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,\n",
      "servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her\n",
      "regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her\n",
      "regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of\n",
      "Miss Hawkins’s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he\n",
      "seemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of\n",
      "his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\n",
      "Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\n",
      "friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet’s mind,\n",
      "Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\n",
      "predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\n",
      "as a check to the other. Mr. Elton’s engagement had been the cure of\n",
      "the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\n",
      "knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\n",
      "Martin’s calling at Mrs. Goddard’s a few days afterwards. Harriet had\n",
      "not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,\n",
      "written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a\n",
      "great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had\n",
      "been much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done\n",
      "in return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.\n",
      "Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the\n",
      "Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for\n",
      "Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\n",
      "judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin’s visit.\n",
      "How that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and what\n",
      "might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\n",
      "Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\n",
      "be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\n",
      "acquaintance—!\n",
      "After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\n",
      "Harriet’s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\n",
      "understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\n",
      "acquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\n",
      "Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so\n",
      "soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\n",
      "recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\n",
      "of intimacy was chosen for the future.\n",
      "She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\n",
      "which her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude, merely\n",
      "glossed over—it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\n",
      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\n",
      "friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard’s, her evil stars had led her to\n",
      "the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\n",
      "Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\n",
      "being lifted into the butcher’s cart, which was to convey it to where\n",
      "the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\n",
      "and the direction, was consequently a blank.\n",
      "She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\n",
      "put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\n",
      "espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\n",
      "had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\n",
      "revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed\n",
      "her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which\n",
      "determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of\n",
      "an hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old\n",
      "servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\n",
      "The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\n",
      "and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\n",
      "unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\n",
      "gravel walk—a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\n",
      "her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\n",
      "Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\n",
      "feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\n",
      "understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\n",
      "She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\n",
      "doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace\n",
      "had been talked almost all the time—till just at last, when Mrs.\n",
      "Martin’s saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was\n",
      "grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.\n",
      "In that very room she had been measured last September, with her two\n",
      "friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot\n",
      "by the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day,\n",
      "the hour, the party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the\n",
      "same regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and\n",
      "they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must\n",
      "suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when\n",
      "the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and\n",
      "the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to\n",
      "be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six\n",
      "months ago!—Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they\n",
      "might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business.\n",
      "She would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\n",
      "the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\n",
      "_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\n",
      "have done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could not repent. They must be\n",
      "separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to\n",
      "herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\n",
      "consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure\n",
      "it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\n",
      "refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\n",
      "It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that\n",
      "neither “master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some\n",
      "time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\n",
      "“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now we shall\n",
      "just miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so\n",
      "disappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\n",
      "murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both—such being\n",
      "the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the\n",
      "carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who\n",
      "were standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight\n",
      "of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for Mr.\n",
      "Weston immediately accosted her with,\n",
      "“How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father—glad\n",
      "to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I had a letter this\n",
      "morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at\n",
      "Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\n",
      "so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\n",
      "was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\n",
      "just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\n",
      "enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\n",
      "wish.”\n",
      "There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\n",
      "influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston’s, confirmed as it all was\n",
      "by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but\n",
      "not less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain\n",
      "was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice\n",
      "in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted\n",
      "spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was\n",
      "coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s thought, she hoped Mr.\n",
      "Elton would now be talked of no more.\n",
      "Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\n",
      "allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his\n",
      "command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she\n",
      "listened, and smiled, and congratulated.\n",
      "“I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.\n",
      "Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "“We had better move on, Mr. Weston,” said she, “we are detaining the\n",
      "girls.”\n",
      "“Well, well, I am ready;”—and turning again to Emma, “but you must not\n",
      "be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\n",
      "account you know; I dare say he is really nothing\n",
      "extraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\n",
      "speaking a very different conviction.\n",
      "Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\n",
      "manner that appropriated nothing.\n",
      "“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,” was Mrs.\n",
      "Weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\n",
      "for her.\n",
      "“Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three,” was Mr.\n",
      "Weston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\n",
      "Emma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a\n",
      "different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\n",
      "before. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\n",
      "must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\n",
      "something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\n",
      "“Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was a\n",
      "question, however, which did not augur much.\n",
      "But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\n",
      "was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\n",
      "The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston’s faithful\n",
      "pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that\n",
      "she was to think of her at four.\n",
      "“My dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental soliloquy, while\n",
      "walking downstairs from her own room, “always overcareful for every\n",
      "body’s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\n",
      "going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.” The\n",
      "clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. “’Tis twelve; I\n",
      "shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time\n",
      "to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\n",
      "possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\n",
      "soon.”\n",
      "She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\n",
      "father—Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\n",
      "minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of\n",
      "Frank’s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the\n",
      "midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,\n",
      "to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\n",
      "The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was\n",
      "actually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think too\n",
      "much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young\n",
      "man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his\n",
      "countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his\n",
      "father’s; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that she\n",
      "should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a\n",
      "readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be\n",
      "acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\n",
      "He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\n",
      "eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\n",
      "earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\n",
      "“I told you yesterday,” cried Mr. Weston with exultation, “I told you\n",
      "all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\n",
      "used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\n",
      "getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\n",
      "upon one’s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\n",
      "more than any little exertion it needs.”\n",
      "“It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the young\n",
      "man, “though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\n",
      "but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.”\n",
      "The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\n",
      "Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\n",
      "conviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\n",
      "with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\n",
      "allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\n",
      "Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\n",
      "to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\n",
      "one’s _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\n",
      "he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\n",
      "passed suspiciously through Emma’s brain; but still, if it were a\n",
      "falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner\n",
      "had no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if\n",
      "in a state of no common enjoyment.\n",
      "Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\n",
      "acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,—“Was she a\n",
      "horsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large\n",
      "neighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There were\n",
      "several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they balls?—Was\n",
      "it a musical society?”\n",
      "But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\n",
      "proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\n",
      "their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\n",
      "mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so\n",
      "much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured\n",
      "to his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an\n",
      "additional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly\n",
      "thinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word\n",
      "of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.\n",
      "Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He\n",
      "understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His\n",
      "father’s marriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend\n",
      "must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a\n",
      "blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest\n",
      "obligation on him.”\n",
      "He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor’s merits,\n",
      "without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\n",
      "was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse’s\n",
      "character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor’s. And at last, as if\n",
      "resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\n",
      "object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\n",
      "her person.\n",
      "“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he; “but I\n",
      "confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\n",
      "very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\n",
      "I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”\n",
      "“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,”\n",
      "said Emma; “were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\n",
      "with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\n",
      "such words. Don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a\n",
      "pretty young woman.”\n",
      "“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a\n",
      "gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I\n",
      "might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\n",
      "terms.”\n",
      "Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\n",
      "their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her\n",
      "mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be\n",
      "considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must\n",
      "see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they\n",
      "were agreeable.\n",
      "She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\n",
      "eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\n",
      "expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she\n",
      "was confident that he was often listening.\n",
      "Her own father’s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\n",
      "entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\n",
      "was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\n",
      "approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—Though always objecting to\n",
      "every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the\n",
      "apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any\n",
      "two persons’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\n",
      "were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\n",
      "now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\n",
      "glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\n",
      "his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\n",
      "Frank Churchill’s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\n",
      "of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\n",
      "anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which,\n",
      "however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\n",
      "after another night.\n",
      "A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.—“He must be going.\n",
      "He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\n",
      "for Mrs. Weston at Ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” His\n",
      "son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\n",
      "“As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\n",
      "of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\n",
      "may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a\n",
      "neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\n",
      "Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\n",
      "I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the\n",
      "proper name—I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\n",
      "family of that name?”\n",
      "“To be sure we do,” cried his father; “Mrs. Bates—we passed her house—I\n",
      "saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss\n",
      "Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.\n",
      "Call upon her, by all means.”\n",
      "“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said the young\n",
      "man; “another day would do as well; but there was that degree of\n",
      "acquaintance at Weymouth which—”\n",
      "“Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\n",
      "cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\n",
      "any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You\n",
      "saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she\n",
      "mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely\n",
      "enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.”\n",
      "The son looked convinced.\n",
      "“I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,” said Emma; “she is a very\n",
      "elegant young woman.”\n",
      "He agreed to it, but with so quiet a “Yes,” as inclined her almost to\n",
      "doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\n",
      "of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\n",
      "only ordinarily gifted with it.\n",
      "“If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,” said\n",
      "she, “I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her\n",
      "and hear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has\n",
      "an aunt who never holds her tongue.”\n",
      "“You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?” said Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; “then give\n",
      "me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\n",
      "lady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\n",
      "worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\n",
      "glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\n",
      "shew you the way.”\n",
      "“My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.”\n",
      "“But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\n",
      "quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\n",
      "houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\n",
      "unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\n",
      "had best cross the street.”\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\n",
      "and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, “My good friend,\n",
      "this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\n",
      "it, and as to Mrs. Bates’s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\n",
      "step, and jump.”\n",
      "They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\n",
      "graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma\n",
      "remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and\n",
      "could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,\n",
      "with full confidence in their comfort.\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He\n",
      "had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\n",
      "till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their\n",
      "walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very\n",
      "pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\n",
      "chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\n",
      "would be his constant attraction.”—Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\n",
      "for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction\n",
      "with him. They walked thither directly.\n",
      "Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\n",
      "half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\n",
      "nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\n",
      "therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\n",
      "arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\n",
      "company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\n",
      "was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\n",
      "for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\n",
      "was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid\n",
      "his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole\n",
      "manner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of\n",
      "considering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there was\n",
      "time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit\n",
      "included all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about\n",
      "together for an hour or two—first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,\n",
      "and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired\n",
      "Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse’s ear; and when their going\n",
      "farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with\n",
      "the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much\n",
      "oftener than Emma could have supposed.\n",
      "Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\n",
      "begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\n",
      "which had been the home of his father’s father; and on recollecting\n",
      "that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\n",
      "of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\n",
      "some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\n",
      "shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\n",
      "be very like a merit to those he was with.\n",
      "Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\n",
      "could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\n",
      "absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a\n",
      "parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had\n",
      "not done him justice.\n",
      "Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\n",
      "the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\n",
      "were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\n",
      "run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\n",
      "any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\n",
      "the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a\n",
      "ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\n",
      "populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;—but such\n",
      "brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\n",
      "which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\n",
      "among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\n",
      "interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\n",
      "passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\n",
      "windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\n",
      "and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no\n",
      "fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No,\n",
      "it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\n",
      "very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\n",
      "fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the\n",
      "former good old days of the room?—She who could do any thing in\n",
      "Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\n",
      "that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\n",
      "to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\n",
      "persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\n",
      "not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when\n",
      "particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling\n",
      "to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing,\n",
      "or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s\n",
      "returning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a\n",
      "young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to\n",
      "see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the\n",
      "habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,\n",
      "cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing\n",
      "of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was,\n",
      "perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank,\n",
      "bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however,\n",
      "of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively\n",
      "spirits.\n",
      "At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and\n",
      "being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\n",
      "recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\n",
      "paid it.\n",
      "“Yes, oh! yes”—he replied; “I was just going to mention it. A very\n",
      "successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\n",
      "obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\n",
      "me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\n",
      "was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\n",
      "would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;\n",
      "and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him—but\n",
      "there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I\n",
      "found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that\n",
      "I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an\n",
      "hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”\n",
      "“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”\n",
      "“Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\n",
      "ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\n",
      "Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\n",
      "pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most\n",
      "deplorable want of complexion.”\n",
      "Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax’s complexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would\n",
      "not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness\n",
      "and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character\n",
      "of her face.” He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he\n",
      "had heard many people say the same—but yet he must confess, that to him\n",
      "nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.\n",
      "Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them\n",
      "all; and where they were good, the effect was—fortunately he need not\n",
      "attempt to describe what the effect was.\n",
      "“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about taste.—At least you\n",
      "admire her except her complexion.”\n",
      "He shook his head and laughed.—“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\n",
      "complexion.”\n",
      "“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same\n",
      "society?”\n",
      "At this moment they were approaching Ford’s, and he hastily exclaimed,\n",
      "“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\n",
      "their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\n",
      "says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford’s. If\n",
      "it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\n",
      "myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\n",
      "buy something at Ford’s. It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say\n",
      "they sell gloves.”\n",
      "“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\n",
      "be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\n",
      "you were Mr. Weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at Ford’s, and your\n",
      "popularity will stand upon your own virtues.”\n",
      "They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “Men’s Beavers”\n",
      "and “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\n",
      "said—“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\n",
      "you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\n",
      "_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\n",
      "public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\n",
      "private life.”\n",
      "“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\n",
      "party at Weymouth.”\n",
      "“And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\n",
      "very unfair one. It is always the lady’s right to decide on the degree\n",
      "of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I\n",
      "shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”\n",
      "“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\n",
      "her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\n",
      "reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\n",
      "body, that I really think you may say what you like of your\n",
      "acquaintance with her.”\n",
      "“May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\n",
      "well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\n",
      "little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\n",
      "Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\n",
      "warm-hearted woman. I like them all.”\n",
      "“You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is\n",
      "destined to be?”\n",
      "“Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.”\n",
      "“You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling;\n",
      "“remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\n",
      "when you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life. I will move a\n",
      "little farther off.”\n",
      "“I certainly do forget to think of _her_,” said Emma, “as having ever\n",
      "been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”\n",
      "He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\n",
      "When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “Did\n",
      "you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?” said Frank\n",
      "Churchill.\n",
      "“Ever hear her!” repeated Emma. “You forget how much she belongs to\n",
      "Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\n",
      "She plays charmingly.”\n",
      "“You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could\n",
      "really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\n",
      "considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am\n",
      "excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of\n",
      "judging of any body’s performance.—I have been used to hear her’s\n",
      "admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a\n",
      "man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman—engaged to\n",
      "her—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to\n",
      "sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\n",
      "instead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\n",
      "That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.”\n",
      "“Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.—“Mr. Dixon is very musical,\n",
      "is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\n",
      "than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\n",
      "very strong proof.”\n",
      "“Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\n",
      "than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\n",
      "to me. I could not excuse a man’s having more music than love—more ear\n",
      "than eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\n",
      "How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?”\n",
      "“It was her very particular friend, you know.”\n",
      "“Poor comfort!” said Emma, laughing. “One would rather have a stranger\n",
      "preferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might\n",
      "not recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend\n",
      "always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor\n",
      "Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.”\n",
      "“You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\n",
      "really did not seem to feel it.”\n",
      "“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be\n",
      "it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or\n",
      "dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt\n",
      "it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\n",
      "distinction.”\n",
      "“As to that—I do not—”\n",
      "“Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax’s\n",
      "sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\n",
      "being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\n",
      "was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.”\n",
      "“There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all—” he\n",
      "began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, “however, it is\n",
      "impossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might\n",
      "all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\n",
      "outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a\n",
      "better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\n",
      "herself in critical situations, than I can be.”\n",
      "“I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and\n",
      "women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\n",
      "intimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\n",
      "her friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\n",
      "little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to\n",
      "take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always\n",
      "was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her\n",
      "reserve—I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.”\n",
      "“It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,” said he. “Oftentimes very\n",
      "convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\n",
      "but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.”\n",
      "“Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\n",
      "may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\n",
      "agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\n",
      "conquering any body’s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\n",
      "Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\n",
      "ill of her—not the least—except that such extreme and perpetual\n",
      "cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\n",
      "about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something\n",
      "to conceal.”\n",
      "He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\n",
      "thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\n",
      "that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He\n",
      "was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in\n",
      "some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore\n",
      "better than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate—his\n",
      "feelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of\n",
      "considering Mr. Elton’s house, which, as well as the church, he would\n",
      "go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,\n",
      "he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to\n",
      "be pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,\n",
      "he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There\n",
      "must be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a\n",
      "blockhead who wanted more.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking\n",
      "about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking\n",
      "how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he\n",
      "could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small\n",
      "one. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\n",
      "was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to\n",
      "settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not\n",
      "be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no\n",
      "housekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but no doubt he did\n",
      "perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that\n",
      "whenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to\n",
      "be allowed an early establishment.\n",
      "CHAPTER VII\n",
      "Emma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\n",
      "following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to\n",
      "have his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at\n",
      "breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\n",
      "return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\n",
      "having his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling\n",
      "sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of\n",
      "foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not\n",
      "accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even\n",
      "the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to\n",
      "discern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\n",
      "restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\n",
      "heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\n",
      "liable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and\n",
      "thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was\n",
      "clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making\n",
      "no other comment than that “all young people would have their little\n",
      "whims.”\n",
      "With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\n",
      "hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\n",
      "himself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\n",
      "appeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and\n",
      "lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great\n",
      "deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond\n",
      "of talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were\n",
      "left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\n",
      "acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\n",
      "speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\n",
      "such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\n",
      "denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\n",
      "had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of\n",
      "being at least very near it, and saved only by her own\n",
      "indifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the\n",
      "honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have\n",
      "some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\n",
      "extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\n",
      "much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\n",
      "harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their\n",
      "little whims.”\n",
      "There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\n",
      "leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\n",
      "of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were\n",
      "made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who\n",
      "smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them\n",
      "not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles—Mr.\n",
      "Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,\n",
      "he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to\n",
      "himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! just the trifling,\n",
      "silly fellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an\n",
      "instant’s observation convinced her that it was really said only to\n",
      "relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she\n",
      "let it pass.\n",
      "Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly\n",
      "opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make\n",
      "Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted\n",
      "exactly the advice they gave.\n",
      "This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in\n",
      "Highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and\n",
      "unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in\n",
      "trade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the\n",
      "country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping\n",
      "little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two\n",
      "had brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had\n",
      "yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.\n",
      "With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,\n",
      "their inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their\n",
      "number of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time\n",
      "were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at\n",
      "Hartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared\n",
      "every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly\n",
      "among the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best\n",
      "families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither\n",
      "Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,\n",
      "if they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be\n",
      "giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were\n",
      "very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was\n",
      "not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would\n",
      "visit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only\n",
      "from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\n",
      "But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\n",
      "before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\n",
      "very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\n",
      "invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston’s accounting for it with “I suppose they will not take the\n",
      "liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite\n",
      "sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\n",
      "refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled\n",
      "there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,\n",
      "occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been\n",
      "tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the\n",
      "Bateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the\n",
      "day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her\n",
      "absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of\n",
      "his. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her\n",
      "spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the\n",
      "omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\n",
      "It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\n",
      "Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\n",
      "first remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,”\n",
      "she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\n",
      "that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\n",
      "She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without\n",
      "inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\n",
      "properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much\n",
      "consideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour\n",
      "earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\n",
      "London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\n",
      "air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\n",
      "of his company.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\n",
      "briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without\n",
      "neglecting his comfort—how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,\n",
      "might be depended on for bearing him company—Mr. Woodhouse was to be\n",
      "talked into an acquiescence of his daughter’s going out to dinner on a\n",
      "day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As\n",
      "for _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours\n",
      "would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well\n",
      "resigned.\n",
      "“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he—“I never was. No more is\n",
      "Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\n",
      "should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\n",
      "in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in\n",
      "their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\n",
      "reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\n",
      "evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\n",
      "body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\n",
      "with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to\n",
      "take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be\n",
      "what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, with a look of gentle reproach—“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\n",
      "married, you would have staid at home with me.”\n",
      "“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\n",
      "incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.”\n",
      "But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not\n",
      "lessening, Mr. Woodhouse’s agitation. The ladies knew better how to\n",
      "allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\n",
      "arranged.\n",
      "With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\n",
      "as usual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great\n",
      "regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her.\n",
      "James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer\n",
      "written to Mrs. Cole.”\n",
      "“You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will\n",
      "say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\n",
      "decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of\n",
      "course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is\n",
      "to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will\n",
      "be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have\n",
      "never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still\n",
      "I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get\n",
      "there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you\n",
      "again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying\n",
      "late. You will get very tired when tea is over.”\n",
      "“But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?”\n",
      "“Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great\n",
      "many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.”\n",
      "“But, my dear sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “if Emma comes away early, it\n",
      "will be breaking up the party.”\n",
      "“And no great harm if it does,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “The sooner every\n",
      "party breaks up, the better.”\n",
      "“But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma’s going\n",
      "away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\n",
      "people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel\n",
      "that any body’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person’s\n",
      "in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I\n",
      "am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\n",
      "been your neighbours these _ten_ years.”\n",
      "“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you\n",
      "for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\n",
      "pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\n",
      "never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\n",
      "he is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of\n",
      "giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\n",
      "rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\n",
      "little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\n",
      "will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.”\n",
      "“Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\n",
      "scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\n",
      "only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not\n",
      "being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\n",
      "know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\n",
      "yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of\n",
      "that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\n",
      "up.”\n",
      "He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if\n",
      "she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\n",
      "hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\n",
      "sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\n",
      "thing were safe in the house, as usual.\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n",
      "Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner\n",
      "waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\n",
      "for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any\n",
      "imperfection which could be concealed.\n",
      "He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\n",
      "good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\n",
      "done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any\n",
      "confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his\n",
      "spirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after\n",
      "seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:—\n",
      "“I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do\n",
      "cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\n",
      "way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.—It\n",
      "depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\n",
      "_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\n",
      "differently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been\n",
      "ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a\n",
      "coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\n",
      "vanities.—No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.”\n",
      "With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a\n",
      "longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\n",
      "inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\n",
      "how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\n",
      "and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\n",
      "now seeing them together for the first time.\n",
      "She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\n",
      "Cole’s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\n",
      "Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\n",
      "his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\n",
      "Her father’s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\n",
      "the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\n",
      "dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\n",
      "dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\n",
      "them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\n",
      "unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\n",
      "them to practise during the meal.—She had provided a plentiful dinner\n",
      "for them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\n",
      "it.\n",
      "She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole’s door; and was pleased to\n",
      "see that it was Mr. Knightley’s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\n",
      "having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\n",
      "independence, was too apt, in Emma’s opinion, to get about as he could,\n",
      "and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\n",
      "She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\n",
      "her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\n",
      "“This is coming as you should do,” said she; “like a gentleman.—I am\n",
      "quite glad to see you.”\n",
      "He thanked her, observing, “How lucky that we should arrive at the same\n",
      "moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\n",
      "you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You\n",
      "might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.”\n",
      "“Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\n",
      "consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\n",
      "beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\n",
      "with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I\n",
      "always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_\n",
      "you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed\n",
      "ashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_\n",
      "I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.”\n",
      "“Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.\n",
      "Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\n",
      "with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\n",
      "not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When\n",
      "the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\n",
      "admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\n",
      "her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\n",
      "and at dinner she found him seated by her—and, as she firmly believed,\n",
      "not without some dexterity on his side.\n",
      "The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\n",
      "unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\n",
      "naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox’s family,\n",
      "the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\n",
      "evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at\n",
      "dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\n",
      "general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\n",
      "fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her\n",
      "neighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to\n",
      "attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating\n",
      "something of her that was expected to be very interesting. She\n",
      "listened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of\n",
      "Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that\n",
      "she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room\n",
      "had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking\n",
      "instrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\n",
      "substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\n",
      "surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and\n",
      "explanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived\n",
      "from Broadwood’s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt\n",
      "and niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates’s account,\n",
      "Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\n",
      "possibly have ordered it—but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\n",
      "that it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from\n",
      "Colonel Campbell.\n",
      "“One can suppose nothing else,” added Mrs. Cole, “and I was only\n",
      "surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\n",
      "had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\n",
      "She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\n",
      "any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\n",
      "to surprize her.”\n",
      "Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\n",
      "subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\n",
      "and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\n",
      "enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\n",
      "listen to Mrs. Cole.\n",
      "“I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\n",
      "more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\n",
      "plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a\n",
      "shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\n",
      "instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a\n",
      "slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I\n",
      "really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\n",
      "drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\n",
      "girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\n",
      "it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\n",
      "any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\n",
      "spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr.\n",
      "Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\n",
      "particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in\n",
      "the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\n",
      "obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\n",
      "really is the reason why the instrument was bought—or else I am sure we\n",
      "ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "may be prevailed with to try it this evening.”\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\n",
      "more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole’s, turned\n",
      "to Frank Churchill.\n",
      "“Why do you smile?” said she.\n",
      "“Nay, why do you?”\n",
      "“Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell’s being so rich\n",
      "and so liberal.—It is a handsome present.”\n",
      "“Very.”\n",
      "“I rather wonder that it was never made before.”\n",
      "“Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”\n",
      "“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must\n",
      "now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”\n",
      "“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\n",
      "Bates’s house.”\n",
      "“You may _say_ what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your\n",
      "_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.”\n",
      "“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\n",
      "acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\n",
      "suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\n",
      "there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\n",
      "be?”\n",
      "“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”\n",
      "“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She\n",
      "must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;\n",
      "and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a\n",
      "young woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare\n",
      "say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.”\n",
      "“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\n",
      "joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day,\n",
      "you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”\n",
      "“Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\n",
      "entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\n",
      "of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting\n",
      "either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the\n",
      "misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a\n",
      "little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without\n",
      "guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular\n",
      "cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the\n",
      "Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and\n",
      "penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of\n",
      "trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer\n",
      "it might have passed; but what can any body’s native air do for them in\n",
      "the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages\n",
      "would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and\n",
      "I dare say in her’s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\n",
      "though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell\n",
      "you what they are.”\n",
      "“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon’s\n",
      "preference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for being very\n",
      "decided.”\n",
      "“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?—A water party;\n",
      "and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.”\n",
      "“He did. I was there—one of the party.”\n",
      "“Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for it\n",
      "seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I should\n",
      "have made some discoveries.”\n",
      "“I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\n",
      "Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon\n",
      "caught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent\n",
      "shock and alarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe\n",
      "it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that\n",
      "was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\n",
      "observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\n",
      "discoveries.”\n",
      "The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in\n",
      "the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\n",
      "obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the\n",
      "table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\n",
      "exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma\n",
      "said,\n",
      "“The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a\n",
      "little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\n",
      "soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.”\n",
      "“And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\n",
      "conclude it to come from the Campbells.”\n",
      "“No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\n",
      "not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\n",
      "would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\n",
      "convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\n",
      "Dixon is a principal in the business.”\n",
      "“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\n",
      "carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\n",
      "you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\n",
      "paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\n",
      "But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that\n",
      "it should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see\n",
      "it in no other light than as an offering of love.”\n",
      "There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction\n",
      "seemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other\n",
      "subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the\n",
      "dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired\n",
      "amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few\n",
      "downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor\n",
      "the other—nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old\n",
      "news, and heavy jokes.\n",
      "The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\n",
      "ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\n",
      "of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\n",
      "dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\n",
      "the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\n",
      "cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\n",
      "alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\n",
      "affection. There she sat—and who would have guessed how many tears she\n",
      "had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\n",
      "seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\n",
      "nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\n",
      "did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad\n",
      "to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\n",
      "mortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\n",
      "vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\n",
      "beloved by the husband of her friend.\n",
      "In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\n",
      "She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\n",
      "secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\n",
      "and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\n",
      "subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\n",
      "consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of\n",
      "guilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend Colonel\n",
      "Campbell.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by\n",
      "the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\n",
      "perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\n",
      "to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\n",
      "of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\n",
      "fair heroine’s countenance.\n",
      "They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of\n",
      "the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\n",
      "handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\n",
      "and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the\n",
      "circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\n",
      "would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be\n",
      "thinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She\n",
      "introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\n",
      "afterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so\n",
      "lovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.” And she, “Only to\n",
      "be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think\n",
      "there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her\n",
      "indignation, and only turned from her in silence.\n",
      "Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\n",
      "glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\n",
      "He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated\n",
      "sitting long—was always the first to move when he could—that his\n",
      "father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\n",
      "parish business—that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\n",
      "pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of\n",
      "gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury\n",
      "altogether—thought it so abundant in agreeable families—that Emma began\n",
      "to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much. She\n",
      "questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire—the extent of the\n",
      "neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his\n",
      "answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little\n",
      "going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,\n",
      "none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations\n",
      "accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health\n",
      "and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\n",
      "person; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not\n",
      "without difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he\n",
      "could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.\n",
      "She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\n",
      "its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement\n",
      "at home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He\n",
      "did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded\n",
      "his aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and\n",
      "noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he\n",
      "could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on\n",
      "which his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much\n",
      "to go abroad—had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she\n",
      "would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he\n",
      "said, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\n",
      "The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\n",
      "good behaviour to his father.\n",
      "“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.—\n",
      "“I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I never knew days fly\n",
      "so fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But\n",
      "just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!—I hate the\n",
      "recollection.”\n",
      "“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\n",
      "of so few, in having your hair cut.”\n",
      "“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have no\n",
      "pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\n",
      "seen.”\n",
      "The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\n",
      "obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\n",
      "When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as\n",
      "before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\n",
      "“What is the matter?” said she.\n",
      "He started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I believe I have\n",
      "been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\n",
      "way—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\n",
      "any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own. I\n",
      "see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is\n",
      "an Irish fashion. Shall I?—Yes, I will—I declare I will—and you shall\n",
      "see how she takes it;—whether she colours.”\n",
      "He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as\n",
      "he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\n",
      "front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\n",
      "Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:—“one can get near\n",
      "every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to\n",
      "you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\n",
      "yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\n",
      "Miss Bates and her niece came here?”\n",
      "“How?—They were invited, were not they?”\n",
      "“Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their\n",
      "coming?”\n",
      "“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”\n",
      "“Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it\n",
      "would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\n",
      "cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\n",
      "her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\n",
      "would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\n",
      "not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\n",
      "and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may\n",
      "guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I\n",
      "made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage\n",
      "would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would\n",
      "be making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as\n",
      "possible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as\n",
      "herself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble\n",
      "us, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was to take them home\n",
      "again.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really quite\n",
      "surprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an\n",
      "attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in\n",
      "short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\n",
      "that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do\n",
      "suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it\n",
      "was only as an excuse for assisting them.”\n",
      "“Very likely,” said Emma—“nothing more likely. I know no man more\n",
      "likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any thing\n",
      "really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\n",
      "gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\n",
      "Fairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for\n",
      "an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\n",
      "more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day—for we arrived\n",
      "together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\n",
      "could betray.”\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more\n",
      "simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while\n",
      "Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have\n",
      "never been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more\n",
      "probable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.\n",
      "Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you\n",
      "company!—What do you say to it?”\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "how could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr. Knightley must\n",
      "not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh!\n",
      "no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am\n",
      "amazed that you should think of such a thing.”\n",
      "“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not\n",
      "want the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea\n",
      "has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished\n",
      "to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of\n",
      "six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?”\n",
      "“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr. Knightley\n",
      "marry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.\n",
      "And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”\n",
      "“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "“But the imprudence of such a match!”\n",
      "“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”\n",
      "“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\n",
      "what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\n",
      "be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for\n",
      "the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax—and is always glad\n",
      "to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to\n",
      "match-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the\n",
      "Abbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not\n",
      "have him do so mad a thing.”\n",
      "“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\n",
      "and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”\n",
      "“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\n",
      "least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He\n",
      "is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\n",
      "his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\n",
      "his brother’s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\n",
      "his time or his heart.”\n",
      "“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\n",
      "loves Jane Fairfax—”\n",
      "“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I\n",
      "am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but—”\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could\n",
      "do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”\n",
      "“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\n",
      "very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\n",
      "Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\n",
      "him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind\n",
      "and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And\n",
      "then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat.\n",
      "‘Not that it was such a very old petticoat either—for still it would\n",
      "last a great while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their\n",
      "petticoats were all very strong.’”\n",
      "“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my\n",
      "conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be\n",
      "much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She\n",
      "might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only\n",
      "talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it\n",
      "would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think\n",
      "he does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of\n",
      "Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—his anxiety about her\n",
      "health—his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have\n",
      "heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of\n",
      "her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him\n",
      "say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost\n",
      "forgotten one idea that occurred to me—this pianoforte that has been\n",
      "sent here by somebody—though we have all been so well satisfied to\n",
      "consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.\n",
      "Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person\n",
      "to do it, even without being in love.”\n",
      "“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\n",
      "think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\n",
      "nothing mysteriously.”\n",
      "“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\n",
      "oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\n",
      "course of things, occur to him.”\n",
      "“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\n",
      "her so.”\n",
      "“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very\n",
      "strong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly\n",
      "silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.”\n",
      "“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\n",
      "many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment—I\n",
      "believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that\n",
      "Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”\n",
      "They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\n",
      "gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the\n",
      "most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed\n",
      "them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;—and at the\n",
      "same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do\n",
      "them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the\n",
      "eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing\n",
      "nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.\n",
      "Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it\n",
      "suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.\n",
      "She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more\n",
      "than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit\n",
      "in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could\n",
      "accompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her\n",
      "agreeably by surprize—a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank\n",
      "Churchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and\n",
      "every thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful\n",
      "voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and\n",
      "that he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly\n",
      "asserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her\n",
      "place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,\n",
      "she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely\n",
      "superior to her own.\n",
      "With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\n",
      "numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\n",
      "They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\n",
      "sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\n",
      "Emma’s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\n",
      "Mrs. Weston’s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united\n",
      "voices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s marrying did not in the least subside. She could see\n",
      "nothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children—a\n",
      "most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great\n",
      "deduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could\n",
      "not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\n",
      "Knightley for them all to give way to!—No—Mr. Knightley must never\n",
      "marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\n",
      "Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\n",
      "talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\n",
      "very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\n",
      "struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\n",
      "kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\n",
      "the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate\n",
      "only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\n",
      "“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our carriage\n",
      "more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;\n",
      "but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should\n",
      "put-to for such a purpose.”\n",
      "“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he\n",
      "replied;—“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he smiled with\n",
      "such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\n",
      "step.\n",
      "“This present from the Campbells,” said she—“this pianoforte is very\n",
      "kindly given.”\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent\n",
      "embarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her\n",
      "notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\n",
      "enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\n",
      "expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.”\n",
      "From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\n",
      "had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely\n",
      "free from peculiar attachment—whether there were no actual\n",
      "preference—remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane’s\n",
      "second song, her voice grew thick.\n",
      "“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—“you have\n",
      "sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.”\n",
      "Another song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;—they would not\n",
      "fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.”\n",
      "And Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could manage this\n",
      "without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\n",
      "song falls on the second.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley grew angry.\n",
      "“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off\n",
      "his own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates, who at that\n",
      "moment passed near—“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\n",
      "herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be\n",
      "grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\n",
      "singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but\n",
      "soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing—originating nobody\n",
      "exactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,\n",
      "that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an\n",
      "irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming\n",
      "gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\n",
      "While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\n",
      "Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\n",
      "voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\n",
      "Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\n",
      "were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\n",
      "something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to\n",
      "Mrs. Cole—he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody\n",
      "else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\n",
      "Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\n",
      "she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\n",
      "five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it\n",
      "made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\n",
      "partner. They were a couple worth looking at.\n",
      "Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\n",
      "growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her\n",
      "mother’s account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to\n",
      "begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,\n",
      "and have done.\n",
      "“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\n",
      "her carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\n",
      "would not have agreed with me, after yours.”\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\n",
      "afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\n",
      "might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\n",
      "be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\n",
      "the Coles—worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!—And left a name\n",
      "behind her that would not soon die away.\n",
      "Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\n",
      "points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\n",
      "transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\n",
      "Jane Fairfax’s feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\n",
      "had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his\n",
      "submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,\n",
      "which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to\n",
      "have held her tongue.\n",
      "The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\n",
      "there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret\n",
      "the inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\n",
      "grieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and practised\n",
      "vigorously an hour and a half.\n",
      "She was then interrupted by Harriet’s coming in; and if Harriet’s\n",
      "praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\n",
      "“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”\n",
      "“Don’t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her’s,\n",
      "than a lamp is like sunshine.”\n",
      "“Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\n",
      "as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\n",
      "last night said how well you played.”\n",
      "“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\n",
      "truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\n",
      "but Jane Fairfax’s is much beyond it.”\n",
      "“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\n",
      "that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\n",
      "said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great\n",
      "deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than\n",
      "execution.”\n",
      "“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”\n",
      "“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\n",
      "taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no\n",
      "understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\n",
      "know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\n",
      "teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\n",
      "any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?”\n",
      "“Just as they always do—very vulgar.”\n",
      "“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly; “but it is\n",
      "nothing of any consequence.”\n",
      "Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\n",
      "producing Mr. Elton.\n",
      "“They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay\n",
      "to dinner.”\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\n",
      "what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay\n",
      "there again next summer.”\n",
      "“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\n",
      "be.”\n",
      "“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her\n",
      "at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to\n",
      "marry him.”\n",
      "“Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\n",
      "girls in Highbury.”\n",
      "Harriet had business at Ford’s.—Emma thought it most prudent to go with\n",
      "her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\n",
      "her present state, would be dangerous.\n",
      "Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\n",
      "very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\n",
      "and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.—Much could\n",
      "not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr.\n",
      "Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\n",
      "office-door, Mr. Cole’s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\n",
      "stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\n",
      "could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher\n",
      "with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her\n",
      "full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of\n",
      "dawdling children round the baker’s little bow-window eyeing the\n",
      "gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused\n",
      "enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at\n",
      "ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\n",
      "appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\n",
      "Highbury;—to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\n",
      "first place at Mrs. Bates’s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls\n",
      "than Ford’s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\n",
      "eye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\n",
      "agreeableness of yesterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure\n",
      "to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to\n",
      "call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\n",
      "“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss\n",
      "Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\n",
      "myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\n",
      "am going now.”\n",
      "“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said\n",
      "Frank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield—if\n",
      "you are going home.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was disappointed.\n",
      "“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.”\n",
      "“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in the\n",
      "way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt\n",
      "always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to\n",
      "death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.\n",
      "What am I to do?”\n",
      "“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only waiting for\n",
      "my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\n",
      "But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”\n",
      "“Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\n",
      "have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\n",
      "indifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would\n",
      "be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the\n",
      "world at a civil falsehood.”\n",
      "“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.—“I am persuaded that\n",
      "you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\n",
      "there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\n",
      "otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax’s opinion last night.”\n",
      "“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very disagreeable to\n",
      "you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We\n",
      "will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\n",
      "will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.”\n",
      "He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\n",
      "returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates’s door. Emma watched them in,\n",
      "and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all\n",
      "the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\n",
      "muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\n",
      "it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\n",
      "last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\n",
      "“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard’s, ma’am?” asked Mrs.\n",
      "Ford.—“Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard’s. Only my pattern gown is at\n",
      "Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown\n",
      "home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go\n",
      "to Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\n",
      "Mrs. Ford, could not you?”\n",
      "“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\n",
      "parcels.”\n",
      "“No more it is.”\n",
      "“No trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\n",
      "“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\n",
      "please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s—I do not know—No, I\n",
      "think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield,\n",
      "and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?”\n",
      "“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\n",
      "if you please, Mrs. Ford.”\n",
      "“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should\n",
      "not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard’s.”\n",
      "Voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\n",
      "Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\n",
      "“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run across to\n",
      "entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\n",
      "and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\n",
      "do you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston\n",
      "to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”\n",
      "“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—”\n",
      "“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\n",
      "and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad\n",
      "to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh!\n",
      "then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\n",
      "just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\n",
      "very happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\n",
      "refuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss Woodhouse’s\n",
      "opinion of the instrument will be worth having.’—But, said I, I shall\n",
      "be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said\n",
      "he, ‘wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you\n",
      "believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\n",
      "the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet\n",
      "came out, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had\n",
      "no use of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\n",
      "body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane\n",
      "said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I\n",
      "did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one\n",
      "thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time\n",
      "Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh,\n",
      "said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet\n",
      "of your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home,\n",
      "Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging\n",
      "to us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say that Mrs.\n",
      "Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never\n",
      "known any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be\n",
      "for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,\n",
      "you know? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really\n",
      "eats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite\n",
      "frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she\n",
      "eats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But\n",
      "about the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she\n",
      "likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\n",
      "for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I\n",
      "happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before—I\n",
      "have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it\n",
      "is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly\n",
      "wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an\n",
      "excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I\n",
      "hope, and these ladies will oblige us.”\n",
      "Emma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they did at\n",
      "last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\n",
      "“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\n",
      "I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\n",
      "came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a\n",
      "little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”\n",
      "“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all\n",
      "in the street.\n",
      "Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\n",
      "“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my mother’s\n",
      "spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I\n",
      "do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\n",
      "excessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\n",
      "say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\n",
      "he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘Oh!’\n",
      "said he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\n",
      "excessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\n",
      "the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so\n",
      "very obliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is\n",
      "nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the\n",
      "finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you\n",
      "know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no\n",
      "compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis\n",
      "does them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice,\n",
      "and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples\n",
      "themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\n",
      "from Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends us a\n",
      "sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\n",
      "anywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother\n",
      "says the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was\n",
      "really quite shocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one\n",
      "morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and\n",
      "said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to\n",
      "the end of our stock. ‘I am sure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will\n",
      "send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever\n",
      "use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this\n",
      "year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.’ So\n",
      "I begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone, I could not\n",
      "absolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen\n",
      "indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all\n",
      "bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been\n",
      "already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost\n",
      "quarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a\n",
      "quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\n",
      "apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a\n",
      "great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.\n",
      "However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large\n",
      "basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was\n",
      "very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said\n",
      "every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old\n",
      "acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found\n",
      "afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of\n",
      "_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his master\n",
      "had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it\n",
      "himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for\n",
      "William, you know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing;\n",
      "but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent\n",
      "away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have\n",
      "another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not\n",
      "mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.\n",
      "Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were\n",
      "sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me,\n",
      "and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\n",
      "know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\n",
      "to keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\n",
      "before I was aware.”\n",
      "Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\n",
      "walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\n",
      "pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\n",
      "“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\n",
      "care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and\n",
      "narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\n",
      "Smith, the step at the turning.”\n",
      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\n",
      "tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\n",
      "slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\n",
      "her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\n",
      "standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\n",
      "Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\n",
      "happy countenance on seeing Emma again.\n",
      "“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least\n",
      "ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\n",
      "useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”\n",
      "“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not\n",
      "earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”\n",
      "“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I have been\n",
      "assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\n",
      "it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\n",
      "we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to\n",
      "be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”\n",
      "He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\n",
      "employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to\n",
      "make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite\n",
      "ready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately\n",
      "ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had\n",
      "not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without\n",
      "emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and\n",
      "Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could\n",
      "not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\n",
      "At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\n",
      "powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined\n",
      "her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\n",
      "discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\n",
      "“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with a\n",
      "smile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\n",
      "Colonel Campbell’s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\n",
      "notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\n",
      "particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\n",
      "friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not\n",
      "you think so?”\n",
      "Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\n",
      "been speaking to her at the same moment.\n",
      "“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. Do\n",
      "not distress her.”\n",
      "He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\n",
      "doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\n",
      "“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on\n",
      "this occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and\n",
      "wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s\n",
      "coming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to\n",
      "be going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the\n",
      "consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have\n",
      "sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to\n",
      "depend upon contingencies and conveniences?”\n",
      "He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\n",
      "“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice of\n",
      "forced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\n",
      "all conjecture.”\n",
      "“Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\n",
      "conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\n",
      "rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at\n",
      "work, if one talks at all;—your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\n",
      "tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—Miss\n",
      "Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have\n",
      "the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,\n",
      "healed for the present.”\n",
      "He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\n",
      "little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\n",
      "“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the waltzes we\n",
      "danced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\n",
      "as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\n",
      "danced no longer; but I would have given worlds—all the worlds one ever\n",
      "has to give—for another half-hour.”\n",
      "She played.\n",
      "“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\n",
      "happy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”\n",
      "She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\n",
      "something else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\n",
      "and turning to Emma, said,\n",
      "“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here\n",
      "are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\n",
      "expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\n",
      "Colonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\n",
      "here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\n",
      "have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\n",
      "incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”\n",
      "Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\n",
      "and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the\n",
      "remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of\n",
      "consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less\n",
      "scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to\n",
      "her.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently\n",
      "cherishing very reprehensible feelings.\n",
      "He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.—Emma\n",
      "took the opportunity of whispering,\n",
      "“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”\n",
      "“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\n",
      "ashamed of my meaning.”\n",
      "“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the\n",
      "idea.”\n",
      "“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\n",
      "a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\n",
      "wrong, she ought to feel it.”\n",
      "“She is not entirely without it, I think.”\n",
      "“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\n",
      "moment—_his_ favourite.”\n",
      "Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\n",
      "Knightley on horse-back not far off.\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to\n",
      "thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\n",
      "but I can go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in\n",
      "when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\n",
      "so!—Our little room so honoured!”\n",
      "She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\n",
      "casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley’s attention, and every\n",
      "syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others,\n",
      "as if it had passed within the same apartment.\n",
      "“How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\n",
      "for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\n",
      "for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”\n",
      "So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\n",
      "his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\n",
      "“How is your niece, Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all, but\n",
      "particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold\n",
      "last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”\n",
      "And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\n",
      "her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\n",
      "Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\n",
      "steady scepticism.\n",
      "“So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage,”\n",
      "resumed Miss Bates.\n",
      "He cut her short with,\n",
      "“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”\n",
      "“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\n",
      "wanted something from Kingston.”\n",
      "“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?”\n",
      "“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new\n",
      "pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”\n",
      "“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”\n",
      "“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful;\n",
      "so many friends!”\n",
      "“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\n",
      "to Kingston as fast as I can.”\n",
      "“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”\n",
      "“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear\n",
      "the pianoforte.”\n",
      "“Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\n",
      "night; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not\n",
      "it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\n",
      "thing equal to it.”\n",
      "“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\n",
      "And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\n",
      "not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in\n",
      "England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\n",
      "something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\n",
      "hear it.”\n",
      "“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so\n",
      "shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”\n",
      "“What is the matter now?”\n",
      "“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a\n",
      "great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\n",
      "Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\n",
      "should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\n",
      "can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\n",
      "would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to\n",
      "the room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.\n",
      "He is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.”\n",
      "“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\n",
      "open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\n",
      "have heard every thing to be sure. ‘Can I do any thing for you at\n",
      "Kingston?’ said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must\n",
      "you be going?—You seem but just come—so very obliging of you.”\n",
      "Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\n",
      "long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to\n",
      "be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\n",
      "allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\n",
      "gates, before they set off for Randalls.\n",
      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\n",
      "known of young people passing many, many months successively, without\n",
      "being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\n",
      "either to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the\n",
      "felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt—it\n",
      "must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\n",
      "Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\n",
      "and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\n",
      "to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\n",
      "people in schemes on the subject. Frank’s was the first idea; and his\n",
      "the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of\n",
      "the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and\n",
      "appearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people\n",
      "again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself\n",
      "with Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any of\n",
      "the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room\n",
      "they were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking\n",
      "the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in\n",
      "spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,\n",
      "that it was a little the largest.\n",
      "His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole’s\n",
      "should be finished there—that the same party should be collected, and\n",
      "the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\n",
      "Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\n",
      "and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly\n",
      "who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of\n",
      "space to every couple.\n",
      "“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\n",
      "Coxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be the\n",
      "two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\n",
      "couple there will be plenty of room.”\n",
      "But soon it came to be on one side,\n",
      "“But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think\n",
      "there will.”\n",
      "On another,\n",
      "“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\n",
      "stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\n",
      "It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\n",
      "thought of the moment.”\n",
      "Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother’s, and\n",
      "must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\n",
      "would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\n",
      "put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one\n",
      "family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old\n",
      "acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the\n",
      "five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation\n",
      "in what possible manner they could be disposed of.\n",
      "The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not\n",
      "they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the best\n",
      "scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\n",
      "better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress\n",
      "about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score\n",
      "of health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\n",
      "persevered in.\n",
      "“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\n",
      "bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\n",
      "So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\n",
      "be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\n",
      "not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\n",
      "thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\n",
      "the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and\n",
      "keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\n",
      "draught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\n",
      "quite the thing!”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it,\n",
      "and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\n",
      "closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\n",
      "in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\n",
      "Frank Churchill’s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour\n",
      "before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now\n",
      "endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.\n",
      "“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\n",
      "couple may stand here very well.”\n",
      "Emma demurred. “It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be\n",
      "worse than dancing without space to turn in?”\n",
      "“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went\n",
      "on measuring, and still he ended with,\n",
      "“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”\n",
      "“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\n",
      "to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to\n",
      "be dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room!”\n",
      "“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A\n",
      "crowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\n",
      "pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still, however,\n",
      "having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It\n",
      "would be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—I do not know\n",
      "that—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\n",
      "self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\n",
      "dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\n",
      "Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\n",
      "pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\n",
      "and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\n",
      "acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\n",
      "Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\n",
      "the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\n",
      "the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\n",
      "“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your inclination\n",
      "for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\n",
      "of my father’s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a\n",
      "thought of my father’s, which waits only your approbation to be acted\n",
      "upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\n",
      "of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\n",
      "Crown Inn?”\n",
      "“The Crown!”\n",
      "“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you\n",
      "cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him\n",
      "there. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less\n",
      "grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees\n",
      "no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all\n",
      "feel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the\n",
      "Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how\n",
      "right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_\n",
      "_thing_ to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?—You consent—I hope\n",
      "you consent?”\n",
      "“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\n",
      "myself, shall be most happy—It seems the only improvement that could\n",
      "be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?”\n",
      "She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\n",
      "comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\n",
      "necessary to make it acceptable.\n",
      "“No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much\n",
      "worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\n",
      "never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\n",
      "had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the\n",
      "Crown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh!\n",
      "no—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than\n",
      "anywhere.”\n",
      "“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that one of the\n",
      "great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of\n",
      "any body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the Crown than at\n",
      "Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\n",
      "nobody else could.”\n",
      "“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken\n",
      "if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\n",
      "extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\n",
      "the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father’s house.”\n",
      "“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\n",
      "occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it\n",
      "is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\n",
      "heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”\n",
      "“Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\n",
      "opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\n",
      "heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure, neither\n",
      "your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "“Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\n",
      "window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I\n",
      "have often known it done myself.”\n",
      "“Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\n",
      "live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\n",
      "this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\n",
      "over—but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\n",
      "cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\n",
      "obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\n",
      "can be done.”\n",
      "“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—”\n",
      "“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for talking every\n",
      "thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\n",
      "the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will\n",
      "be so near their own stable.”\n",
      "“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\n",
      "complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\n",
      "be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs. Stokes to be\n",
      "trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”\n",
      "“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\n",
      "under Mrs. Weston’s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.”\n",
      "“There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\n",
      "is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\n",
      "years ago, when I had the measles? ‘If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\n",
      "wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ How often have I\n",
      "heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”\n",
      "“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\n",
      "little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would\n",
      "have been very bad, but for Perry’s great attention. He came four times\n",
      "a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good\n",
      "sort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful\n",
      "complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella’s little ones have the\n",
      "measles, she will send for Perry.”\n",
      "“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said Frank\n",
      "Churchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\n",
      "and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\n",
      "might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\n",
      "desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them,\n",
      "if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\n",
      "satisfactorily without you.”\n",
      "Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\n",
      "engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\n",
      "set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\n",
      "very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and\n",
      "he, finding every thing perfect.\n",
      "“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\n",
      "you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\n",
      "forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”\n",
      "“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What does all\n",
      "that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\n",
      "clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\n",
      "club-nights.”\n",
      "The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know\n",
      "when things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each\n",
      "to himself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless\n",
      "cares.”\n",
      "One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It\n",
      "regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom’s being built,\n",
      "suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\n",
      "the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\n",
      "as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by\n",
      "their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\n",
      "supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\n",
      "purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\n",
      "passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and\n",
      "neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\n",
      "miserably crowded at supper.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c.,\n",
      "set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\n",
      "suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\n",
      "pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\n",
      "expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n",
      "“I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.”\n",
      "And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\n",
      "through the passage, was calling out,\n",
      "“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\n",
      "mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”\n",
      "“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our\n",
      "guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally\n",
      "pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.”\n",
      "“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your neighbours’\n",
      "opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\n",
      "of them—the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\n",
      "upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.—And I do not know\n",
      "whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\n",
      "the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger\n",
      "council. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?”\n",
      "“Well—if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, “if you think\n",
      "she will be of any use.”\n",
      "“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma. “She\n",
      "will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\n",
      "will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in\n",
      "consulting Miss Bates.”\n",
      "“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\n",
      "Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”\n",
      "Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\n",
      "his decided approbation.\n",
      "“Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\n",
      "once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a\n",
      "properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss\n",
      "Bates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of\n",
      "how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.”\n",
      "“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...\n",
      "“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a\n",
      "great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”\n",
      "“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\n",
      "Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.”\n",
      "And away he ran.\n",
      "Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving\n",
      "aunt, and her elegant niece,—Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman\n",
      "and a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of\n",
      "it much less than she had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and\n",
      "here ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation\n",
      "at least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\n",
      "chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\n",
      "as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\n",
      "Stokes.—Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\n",
      "written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\n",
      "which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\n",
      "be.\n",
      "Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As\n",
      "a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\n",
      "character,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and\n",
      "minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\n",
      "half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different\n",
      "rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of\n",
      "the future. The party did not break up without Emma’s being positively\n",
      "secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor\n",
      "without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, “He has asked\n",
      "her, my dear. That’s right. I knew he would!”\n",
      "CHAPTER XII\n",
      "One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\n",
      "satisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term\n",
      "of Frank Churchill’s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston’s\n",
      "confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\n",
      "Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\n",
      "fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\n",
      "their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\n",
      "entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\n",
      "hoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion, the great risk, of\n",
      "its being all in vain.\n",
      "Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\n",
      "wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not\n",
      "opposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\n",
      "solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of\n",
      "her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley’s provoking\n",
      "indifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\n",
      "because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed\n",
      "resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\n",
      "exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\n",
      "To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\n",
      "than,\n",
      "“Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\n",
      "trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\n",
      "against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh! yes, I\n",
      "must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I\n",
      "can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins’s\n",
      "week’s account; much rather, I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not\n",
      "I, indeed—I never look at it—I do not know who does.—Fine dancing, I\n",
      "believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by\n",
      "are usually thinking of something very different.”\n",
      "This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was\n",
      "not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,\n",
      "or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the\n",
      "ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.\n",
      "It made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—\n",
      "“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\n",
      "What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\n",
      "_very_ great pleasure.”\n",
      "It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\n",
      "preferred the society of William Larkins. No!—she was more and more\n",
      "convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There\n",
      "was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his\n",
      "side—but no love.\n",
      "Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\n",
      "days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\n",
      "every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew’s\n",
      "instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without\n",
      "him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when\n",
      "writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\n",
      "unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\n",
      "herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\n",
      "and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\n",
      "The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\n",
      "within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\n",
      "to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred\n",
      "but for her own convenience.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\n",
      "Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom\n",
      "he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\n",
      "expected at Hartfield very soon.”\n",
      "This wretched note was the finale of Emma’s breakfast. When once it had\n",
      "been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\n",
      "loss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man\n",
      "might be feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it\n",
      "would have been!—Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\n",
      "happiest!—“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.\n",
      "Her father’s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill’s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and\n",
      "as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but\n",
      "they would all be safer at home.\n",
      "Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if\n",
      "this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total\n",
      "want of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going\n",
      "away almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\n",
      "sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\n",
      "himself, it was only to say,\n",
      "“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”\n",
      "“But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your only visit\n",
      "to Randalls.”\n",
      "“Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to\n",
      "return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my\n",
      "thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but\n",
      "I am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am afraid it is a custom\n",
      "gone for ever.”\n",
      "“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”\n",
      "“Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the\n",
      "pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\n",
      "foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "why are you always so right?”\n",
      "“Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\n",
      "rather have been merry than wise.”\n",
      "“If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\n",
      "on it. Do not forget your engagement.”\n",
      "Emma looked graciously.\n",
      "“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more\n",
      "precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me\n",
      "less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\n",
      "Highbury!”\n",
      "“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing, “I will\n",
      "venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\n",
      "Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\n",
      "you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\n",
      "coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”\n",
      "He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\n",
      "was convinced that it had been so.\n",
      "“And you must be off this very morning?”\n",
      "“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\n",
      "must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will\n",
      "bring him.”\n",
      "“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\n",
      "Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates’s powerful, argumentative mind might\n",
      "have strengthened yours.”\n",
      "“Yes—I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\n",
      "was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\n",
      "by Miss Bates’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\n",
      "to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\n",
      "laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay\n",
      "my visit, then”—\n",
      "He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\n",
      "“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can hardly be\n",
      "quite without suspicion”—\n",
      "He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\n",
      "what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\n",
      "serious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,\n",
      "in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\n",
      "“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\n",
      "then”—\n",
      "He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\n",
      "on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\n",
      "him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\n",
      "He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\n",
      "passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\n",
      "“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given\n",
      "to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”—\n",
      "He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—He was more\n",
      "in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\n",
      "have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\n",
      "A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\n",
      "Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\n",
      "procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\n",
      "was doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he\n",
      "might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\n",
      "“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. I\n",
      "shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\n",
      "Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\n",
      "it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\n",
      "interested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters\n",
      "I shall be at dear Highbury again.”\n",
      "A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed\n",
      "the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had\n",
      "been the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so\n",
      "sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from\n",
      "his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it\n",
      "too much.\n",
      "It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\n",
      "arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the\n",
      "last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of\n",
      "seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\n",
      "attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\n",
      "fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\n",
      "course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he\n",
      "had _almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what\n",
      "constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but\n",
      "at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,\n",
      "a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all\n",
      "the rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him,\n",
      "in spite of every previous determination against it.\n",
      "“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of listlessness,\n",
      "weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ\n",
      "myself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the\n",
      "house!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world\n",
      "if I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always\n",
      "good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not\n",
      "for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the\n",
      "evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not\n",
      "say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would\n",
      "have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that\n",
      "he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with\n",
      "considerable kindness added,\n",
      "“You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really\n",
      "out of luck; you are very much out of luck!”\n",
      "It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\n",
      "regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was\n",
      "odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\n",
      "headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\n",
      "taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\n",
      "charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\n",
      "ill-health.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIII\n",
      "Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\n",
      "only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\n",
      "deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\n",
      "Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than\n",
      "ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,\n",
      "and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how\n",
      "were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his\n",
      "coming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could\n",
      "not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be\n",
      "less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and\n",
      "cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have\n",
      "faults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat\n",
      "drawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress\n",
      "and close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and\n",
      "inventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary\n",
      "declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection\n",
      "was always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming\n",
      "was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became\n",
      "sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in\n",
      "love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to\n",
      "quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must\n",
      "produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.\n",
      "“I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,” said\n",
      "she.—“In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\n",
      "there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\n",
      "really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\n",
      "not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love.\n",
      "I should be sorry to be more.”\n",
      "Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his\n",
      "feelings.\n",
      "“_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much\n",
      "in love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I\n",
      "must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable\n",
      "to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I imagine he\n",
      "can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had believed\n",
      "me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched.\n",
      "Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at\n",
      "parting would have been different.—Still, however, I must be on my\n",
      "guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it\n",
      "now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him\n",
      "to be quite the sort of man—I do not altogether build upon his\n",
      "steadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them\n",
      "rather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes\n",
      "me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do\n",
      "very well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good thing\n",
      "over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I\n",
      "shall have been let off easily.”\n",
      "When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\n",
      "she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at\n",
      "first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\n",
      "undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\n",
      "the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\n",
      "affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and\n",
      "describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\n",
      "attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\n",
      "apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\n",
      "Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\n",
      "between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\n",
      "just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much\n",
      "more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.—The\n",
      "charm of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more\n",
      "than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either\n",
      "a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and\n",
      "in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by\n",
      "any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\n",
      "her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\n",
      "conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\n",
      "words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse’s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to\n",
      "her.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\n",
      "remembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\n",
      "as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\n",
      "imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\n",
      "Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\n",
      "part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\n",
      "to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she\n",
      "could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without\n",
      "her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew\n",
      "more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent\n",
      "consolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words\n",
      "which clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the\n",
      "idea of Harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. Was it\n",
      "impossible?—No.—Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\n",
      "understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of\n",
      "her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\n",
      "probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—For\n",
      "Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\n",
      "“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.—“I must not think of it. I know\n",
      "the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\n",
      "happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\n",
      "will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\n",
      "friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”\n",
      "It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet’s behalf, though it\n",
      "might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that\n",
      "quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill’s arrival had succeeded Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest\n",
      "interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank\n",
      "Churchill’s disappearance, Mr. Elton’s concerns were assuming the most\n",
      "irresistible form.—His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among\n",
      "them again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over\n",
      "the first letter from Enscombe before “Mr. Elton and his bride” was in\n",
      "every body’s mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick\n",
      "at the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.\n",
      "Elton; and Harriet’s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been\n",
      "lately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston’s ball in view at least, there\n",
      "had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now\n",
      "too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as\n",
      "could stand against the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing, and\n",
      "all.\n",
      "Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\n",
      "reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\n",
      "give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet\n",
      "had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy\n",
      "work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever\n",
      "agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet\n",
      "listened submissively, and said “it was very true—it was just as Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she\n",
      "would not think about them any longer” but no change of subject could\n",
      "avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the\n",
      "Eltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\n",
      "“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\n",
      "You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It\n",
      "was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\n",
      "you.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you—and it will be a\n",
      "painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\n",
      "forgetting it.”\n",
      "Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\n",
      "exclamation. Emma continued,\n",
      "“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\n",
      "less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\n",
      "would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than\n",
      "my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is\n",
      "your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the\n",
      "suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your\n",
      "tranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.\n",
      "They are very important—and sorry I am that you cannot feel them\n",
      "sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very\n",
      "secondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.\n",
      "Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what\n",
      "was due—or rather what would be kind by me.”\n",
      "This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\n",
      "wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\n",
      "loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\n",
      "of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt\n",
      "to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.\n",
      "“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—Want\n",
      "gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for\n",
      "you!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”\n",
      "Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\n",
      "manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\n",
      "well, nor valued her affection so highly before.\n",
      "“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards\n",
      "to herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and\n",
      "tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all\n",
      "the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.\n",
      "It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\n",
      "beloved—which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not—but I\n",
      "know how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the\n",
      "charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!—I would not change\n",
      "you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\n",
      "breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a\n",
      "hundred such—And for a wife—a sensible man’s wife—it is invaluable. I\n",
      "mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\n",
      "interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\n",
      "it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\n",
      "settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\n",
      "not pretty at all.\n",
      "Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to\n",
      "make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she\n",
      "made a point of Harriet’s going with her, that the worst of the\n",
      "business might be gone through as soon as possible.\n",
      "She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\n",
      "which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\n",
      "lace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\n",
      "would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\n",
      "not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too;\n",
      "but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The\n",
      "visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and\n",
      "occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself\n",
      "entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,\n",
      "beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed, and very\n",
      "pleasing.”\n",
      "She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\n",
      "but she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not elegance.—\n",
      "She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\n",
      "was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\n",
      "but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\n",
      "thought at least it would turn out so.\n",
      "As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would not\n",
      "permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was\n",
      "an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a\n",
      "man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\n",
      "was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\n",
      "privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\n",
      "depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\n",
      "Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\n",
      "married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\n",
      "been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\n",
      "little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\n",
      "could be.\n",
      "“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the house,\n",
      "and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?—Is not she\n",
      "very charming?”\n",
      "There was a little hesitation in Emma’s answer.\n",
      "“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”\n",
      "“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”\n",
      "“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”\n",
      "“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”\n",
      "“Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune; and\n",
      "she came in his way.”\n",
      "“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very\n",
      "much attached to him.”\n",
      "“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the woman\n",
      "who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought\n",
      "this the best offer she was likely to have.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody could ever\n",
      "have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\n",
      "superior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different\n",
      "thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit\n",
      "and admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not\n",
      "thrown himself away, is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young\n",
      "woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her ‘Augusta.’\n",
      "How delightful!”\n",
      "When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\n",
      "more and judge better. From Harriet’s happening not to be at Hartfield,\n",
      "and her father’s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\n",
      "of an hour of the lady’s conversation to herself, and could composedly\n",
      "attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs.\n",
      "Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\n",
      "thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be\n",
      "very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school,\n",
      "pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of\n",
      "people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant,\n",
      "and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\n",
      "Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\n",
      "she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\n",
      "might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\n",
      "her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\n",
      "alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\n",
      "The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother\n",
      "Mr. Suckling’s seat;”—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\n",
      "grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\n",
      "modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by\n",
      "the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\n",
      "imagine. “Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the\n",
      "likeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at\n",
      "Maple Grove; her sister’s favourite room.”—Mr. Elton was appealed\n",
      "to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy\n",
      "herself at Maple Grove.”\n",
      "“And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\n",
      "staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\n",
      "could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\n",
      "delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial\n",
      "to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a\n",
      "little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body\n",
      "who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a\n",
      "home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\n",
      "understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\n",
      "what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils\n",
      "of matrimony.”\n",
      "Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\n",
      "for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\n",
      "“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—the\n",
      "grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\n",
      "The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\n",
      "very much in the same way—just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of\n",
      "a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\n",
      "mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\n",
      "who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\n",
      "in the same style.”\n",
      "Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\n",
      "people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\n",
      "extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to\n",
      "attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\n",
      "“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\n",
      "you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”\n",
      "“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\n",
      "know. Surry is the garden of England.”\n",
      "“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\n",
      "counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\n",
      "Surry.”\n",
      "“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. “I\n",
      "never heard any county but Surry called so.”\n",
      "Emma was silenced.\n",
      "“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or\n",
      "summer at farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time\n",
      "for exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I\n",
      "dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds\n",
      "four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_\n",
      "carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely\n",
      "well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season\n",
      "of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly\n",
      "recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much\n",
      "preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you\n",
      "know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as\n",
      "possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored\n",
      "to King’s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,\n",
      "just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many\n",
      "parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”\n",
      "“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\n",
      "striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and\n",
      "we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at\n",
      "home than engage in schemes of pleasure.”\n",
      "“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\n",
      "be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at\n",
      "Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to\n",
      "Bristol, ‘I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I\n",
      "absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the\n",
      "barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her\n",
      "own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.’ Many a time\n",
      "has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I\n",
      "think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from\n",
      "society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to\n",
      "mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too\n",
      "much or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father’s state of\n",
      "health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he\n",
      "should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of\n",
      "its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.”\n",
      "“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\n",
      "benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\n",
      "does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”\n",
      "“Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\n",
      "waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\n",
      "life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\n",
      "that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits,\n",
      "which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\n",
      "recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\n",
      "on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\n",
      "understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\n",
      "so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\n",
      "society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\n",
      "acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\n",
      "always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\n",
      "attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\n",
      "with.”\n",
      "It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of\n",
      "her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\n",
      "_introduction_—of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\n",
      "of Mrs. Elton’s—probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help\n",
      "of a boarder, just made a shift to live!—The dignity of Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\n",
      "She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\n",
      "have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to\n",
      "Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced\n",
      "that the place might suit her better than her father.” And then, to\n",
      "prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\n",
      "“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these\n",
      "occasions, a lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has\n",
      "long known that you are a superior performer.”\n",
      "“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\n",
      "performer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a\n",
      "quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\n",
      "music—passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of\n",
      "taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\n",
      "_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\n",
      "delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\n",
      "comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\n",
      "into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life\n",
      "to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\n",
      "Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\n",
      "honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,\n",
      "and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\n",
      "disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had\n",
      "been accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\n",
      "When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n",
      "_world_ I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of\n",
      "retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\n",
      "not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who\n",
      "had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me\n",
      "quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used\n",
      "to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal\n",
      "to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed\n",
      "to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages\n",
      "were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.\n",
      "‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without\n",
      "something of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but\n",
      "without music, life would be a blank to me.’”\n",
      "“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate\n",
      "to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\n",
      "I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\n",
      "pardoned, in consideration of the motive.”\n",
      "“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\n",
      "find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\n",
      "concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\n",
      "musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\n",
      "Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\n",
      "not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\n",
      "particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\n",
      "practice; for married women, you know—there is a sad story against\n",
      "them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.”\n",
      "“But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger,\n",
      "surely?”\n",
      "“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my\n",
      "acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never\n",
      "touches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may be\n",
      "said of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two\n",
      "Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can\n",
      "enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to\n",
      "be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a\n",
      "married woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was\n",
      "half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.”\n",
      "“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in so regular\n",
      "a train—”\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”\n",
      "Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\n",
      "more to say; and, after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them both at\n",
      "home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\n",
      "Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite\n",
      "with me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good—there is\n",
      "something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\n",
      "directly. She was your governess, I think?”\n",
      "Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\n",
      "waited for the affirmative before she went on.\n",
      "“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\n",
      "lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”\n",
      "“Mrs. Weston’s manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good.\n",
      "Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\n",
      "model for any young woman.”\n",
      "“And who do you think came in while we were there?”\n",
      "Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance—and\n",
      "how could she possibly guess?\n",
      "“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley himself!—Was not it\n",
      "lucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\n",
      "seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.’s,\n",
      "I had a great curiosity. ‘My friend Knightley’ had been so often\n",
      "mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\n",
      "cara sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his\n",
      "friend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.\n",
      "Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.”\n",
      "Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\n",
      "breathe.\n",
      "“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse than I had\n",
      "supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!—I could not have believed\n",
      "it. Knightley!—never seen him in her life before, and call him\n",
      "Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\n",
      "vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\n",
      "resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\n",
      "Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\n",
      "he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\n",
      "not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\n",
      "form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\n",
      "Weston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\n",
      "gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\n",
      "my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\n",
      "Churchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\n",
      "would be! Ah! there I am—thinking of him directly. Always the first\n",
      "person to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\n",
      "as regularly into my mind!”—\n",
      "All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her\n",
      "father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons’ departure,\n",
      "and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw her\n",
      "before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\n",
      "was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\n",
      "quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I\n",
      "am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\n",
      "poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\n",
      "young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\n",
      "he had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\n",
      "having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion;\n",
      "I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought\n",
      "to have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it\n",
      "shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into\n",
      "Vicarage Lane.”\n",
      "“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.”\n",
      "“Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects to her\n",
      "if possible. It was being very deficient.”\n",
      "“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\n",
      "should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\n",
      "be no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\n",
      "make so much of them.”\n",
      "“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\n",
      "wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially,\n",
      "is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\n",
      "know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\n",
      "they may.”\n",
      "“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\n",
      "is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\n",
      "such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”\n",
      "“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common\n",
      "politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\n",
      "encouragement to people to marry.”\n",
      "Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\n",
      "_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton’s offences, and long, very long,\n",
      "did they occupy her.\n",
      "CHAPTER XV\n",
      "Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\n",
      "opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\n",
      "Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\n",
      "whenever they met again,—self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\n",
      "and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but\n",
      "so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\n",
      "knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\n",
      "and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\n",
      "Elton’s consequence only could surpass.\n",
      "There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\n",
      "from his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had\n",
      "the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to\n",
      "Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part\n",
      "of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of\n",
      "judging, following the lead of Miss Bates’s good-will, or taking it for\n",
      "granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she\n",
      "professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton’s\n",
      "praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked\n",
      "with a good grace of her being “very pleasant and very elegantly\n",
      "dressed.”\n",
      "In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\n",
      "first. Her feelings altered towards Emma.—Offended, probably, by the\n",
      "little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\n",
      "back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\n",
      "though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\n",
      "necessarily increasing Emma’s dislike. Her manners, too—and Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\n",
      "negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet’s cure; but the\n",
      "sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\n",
      "much.—It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet’s attachment had been\n",
      "an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,\n",
      "under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to\n",
      "him, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the\n",
      "object of their joint dislike.—When they had nothing else to say, it\n",
      "must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity\n",
      "which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader\n",
      "vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\n",
      "merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\n",
      "recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\n",
      "with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration—but without\n",
      "solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\n",
      "befriend her.—Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\n",
      "third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton’s knight-errantry\n",
      "on the subject.—\n",
      "“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave\n",
      "about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\n",
      "ladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very\n",
      "extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\n",
      "well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\n",
      "is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth—but, upon my word,\n",
      "I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated\n",
      "to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to\n",
      "do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\n",
      "must not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those\n",
      "charming lines of the poet,\n",
      "‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\n",
      "    ‘And waste its fragrance on the desert air.’\n",
      "We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”\n",
      "“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma’s calm answer—“and\n",
      "when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax’s situation and\n",
      "understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\n",
      "have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.”\n",
      "“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\n",
      "obscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\n",
      "with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\n",
      "I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\n",
      "feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must\n",
      "confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\n",
      "timidity—and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those\n",
      "who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\n",
      "you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\n",
      "than I can express.”\n",
      "“You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any of\n",
      "Miss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her\n",
      "longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”—\n",
      "“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\n",
      "act. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\n",
      "follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\n",
      "have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\n",
      "which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\n",
      "least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\n",
      "send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\n",
      "than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\n",
      "thing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\n",
      "used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\n",
      "other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\n",
      "Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not\n",
      "at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my\n",
      "resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have\n",
      "her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\n",
      "have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\n",
      "on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\n",
      "extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her\n",
      "shortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\n",
      "brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\n",
      "extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\n",
      "will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of\n",
      "either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often\n",
      "indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\n",
      "seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”\n",
      "“Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought Emma.—“You have not deserved this. You may\n",
      "have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\n",
      "beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs.\n",
      "Elton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.’ Heavens! Let me not suppose\n",
      "that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!—But upon my honour,\n",
      "there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s tongue!”\n",
      "Emma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively\n",
      "addressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton’s side soon afterwards appeared,\n",
      "and she was left in peace—neither forced to be the very particular\n",
      "friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton’s guidance, the very active\n",
      "patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\n",
      "way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\n",
      "She looked on with some amusement.—Miss Bates’s gratitude for Mrs.\n",
      "Elton’s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\n",
      "simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies—the most\n",
      "amiable, affable, delightful woman—just as accomplished and\n",
      "condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma’s only\n",
      "surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and\n",
      "tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with\n",
      "the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!\n",
      "This was astonishing!—She could not have believed it possible that the\n",
      "taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and\n",
      "friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\n",
      "“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.—“To chuse to remain here\n",
      "month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\n",
      "mortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her\n",
      "conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have\n",
      "always loved her with such real, generous affection.”\n",
      "Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\n",
      "were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\n",
      "promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\n",
      "invitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\n",
      "Bates—it all came from her—Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\n",
      "Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\n",
      "contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\n",
      "declined it!\n",
      "“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\n",
      "this invitation,” was Emma’s conclusion. “She must be under some sort\n",
      "of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is\n",
      "great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—She is _not_ to\n",
      "be with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must\n",
      "she consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle.”\n",
      "Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\n",
      "the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\n",
      "apology for Jane.\n",
      "“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my\n",
      "dear Emma—but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\n",
      "good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\n",
      "must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\n",
      "what she goes to.”\n",
      "“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “Miss Fairfax\n",
      "is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\n",
      "Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\n",
      "her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions\n",
      "from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”\n",
      "Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\n",
      "was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\n",
      "replied,\n",
      "“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton’s, I should have imagined, would rather\n",
      "disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton’s invitations I should\n",
      "have imagined any thing but inviting.”\n",
      "“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax were to have\n",
      "been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s eagerness in\n",
      "accepting Mrs. Elton’s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very\n",
      "likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\n",
      "appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\n",
      "spite of the very natural wish of a little change.”\n",
      "Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\n",
      "minutes silence, he said,\n",
      "“Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton does not\n",
      "talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\n",
      "difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\n",
      "amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\n",
      "civility in our personal intercourse with each other—a something more\n",
      "early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\n",
      "may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\n",
      "And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\n",
      "sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\n",
      "and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\n",
      "respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\n",
      "never fell in Mrs. Elton’s way before—and no degree of vanity can\n",
      "prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\n",
      "not in consciousness.”\n",
      "“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little Henry\n",
      "was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\n",
      "irresolute what else to say.\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of her.”\n",
      "“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\n",
      "stopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at once—she hurried\n",
      "on—“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\n",
      "is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\n",
      "other.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\n",
      "leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\n",
      "some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\n",
      "“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\n",
      "a hint of it six weeks ago.”\n",
      "He stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\n",
      "herself know what to think. In a moment he went on—\n",
      "“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\n",
      "say, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure I shall\n",
      "never ask her.”\n",
      "Emma returned her friend’s pressure with interest; and was pleased\n",
      "enough to exclaim,\n",
      "“You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.”\n",
      "He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which\n",
      "shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\n",
      "“So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?”\n",
      "“No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\n",
      "for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just\n",
      "now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without\n",
      "any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the\n",
      "smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You\n",
      "would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were\n",
      "married.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,\n",
      "Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\n",
      "me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\n",
      "you.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\n",
      "woman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\n",
      "not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”\n",
      "Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,” said\n",
      "she, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”\n",
      "“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\n",
      "he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\n",
      "wittier than his neighbours.”\n",
      "“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\n",
      "wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles—what\n",
      "she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\n",
      "in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley—what can she do for Mr.\n",
      "Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her\n",
      "civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\n",
      "weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\n",
      "of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\n",
      "Miss Fairfax’s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton’s\n",
      "acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\n",
      "being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\n",
      "I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\n",
      "with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\n",
      "continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\n",
      "her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\n",
      "exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”\n",
      "“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley—“I do not accuse her of\n",
      "want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong—and her\n",
      "temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\n",
      "but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\n",
      "she used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded to my\n",
      "supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\n",
      "and conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no\n",
      "thought beyond.”\n",
      "“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do\n",
      "you say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax?”\n",
      "“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\n",
      "idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\n",
      "were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\n",
      "disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\n",
      "evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\n",
      "in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\n",
      "never to have a disengaged day.\n",
      "“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead among you.\n",
      "Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\n",
      "the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\n",
      "formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\n",
      "disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\n",
      "been at a loss.”\n",
      "No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\n",
      "perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\n",
      "dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\n",
      "the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\n",
      "card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\n",
      "good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon\n",
      "shew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the\n",
      "spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in\n",
      "which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\n",
      "unbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the\n",
      "evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\n",
      "refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\n",
      "Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\n",
      "Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\n",
      "should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\n",
      "resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\n",
      "ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\n",
      "usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\n",
      "with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\n",
      "The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons,\n",
      "it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\n",
      "course—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\n",
      "be asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was not given with\n",
      "equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\n",
      "by Harriet’s begging to be allowed to decline it. “She would rather not\n",
      "be in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able\n",
      "to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\n",
      "uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\n",
      "rather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\n",
      "she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\n",
      "fortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to\n",
      "give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\n",
      "very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.—\n",
      "Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was\n",
      "more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\n",
      "been.—Mr. Knightley’s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\n",
      "Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\n",
      "“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which\n",
      "was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the same age—and\n",
      "always knowing her—I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never\n",
      "like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her greater\n",
      "attention than I have done.”\n",
      "Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\n",
      "happy.—The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\n",
      "over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\n",
      "Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\n",
      "weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\n",
      "staying one whole day at Hartfield—which one day would be the very day\n",
      "of this party.—His professional engagements did not allow of his being\n",
      "put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\n",
      "so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\n",
      "utmost that his nerves could bear—and here would be a ninth—and Emma\n",
      "apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\n",
      "being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\n",
      "falling in with a dinner-party.\n",
      "She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\n",
      "representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he\n",
      "always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\n",
      "immaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\n",
      "have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\n",
      "instead of his brother.\n",
      "The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\n",
      "Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\n",
      "must be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\n",
      "evening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\n",
      "and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\n",
      "philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\n",
      "chief of even Emma’s vexation.\n",
      "The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\n",
      "agreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\n",
      "waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as\n",
      "elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\n",
      "silence—wanting only to observe enough for Isabella’s information—but\n",
      "Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\n",
      "talk to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a\n",
      "walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It\n",
      "was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\n",
      "“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\n",
      "sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\n",
      "turned directly.”\n",
      "“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home before\n",
      "the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters\n",
      "when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A\n",
      "walk before breakfast does me good.”\n",
      "“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”\n",
      "“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\n",
      "“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\n",
      "yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and\n",
      "Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.\n",
      "The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you\n",
      "have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth\n",
      "going through the rain for.”\n",
      "There was a little blush, and then this answer,\n",
      "“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\n",
      "dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\n",
      "older should make me indifferent about letters.”\n",
      "“Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become indifferent.\n",
      "Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\n",
      "positive curse.”\n",
      "“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\n",
      "friendship.”\n",
      "“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he coolly.\n",
      "“Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.”\n",
      "“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well—I am\n",
      "very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\n",
      "can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\n",
      "to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes\n",
      "the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body\n",
      "dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and\n",
      "therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I\n",
      "think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\n",
      "to-day.”\n",
      "“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of\n",
      "years,” said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of situation\n",
      "which time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time\n",
      "will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the\n",
      "daily circle—but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an\n",
      "old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years\n",
      "hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”\n",
      "It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank\n",
      "you” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\n",
      "in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\n",
      "now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on\n",
      "such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his\n",
      "particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her—and with all\n",
      "his mildest urbanity, said,\n",
      "“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\n",
      "in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies\n",
      "are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\n",
      "complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?”\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\n",
      "solicitude about me.”\n",
      "“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I\n",
      "hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\n",
      "old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\n",
      "do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are\n",
      "both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\n",
      "satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.”\n",
      "The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\n",
      "had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\n",
      "By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\n",
      "remonstrances now opened upon Jane.\n",
      "“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in the\n",
      "rain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you do\n",
      "such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”\n",
      "Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\n",
      "“Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\n",
      "how to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\n",
      "authority.”\n",
      "“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I certainly do\n",
      "feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.—Liable\n",
      "as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\n",
      "careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\n",
      "requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\n",
      "half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your\n",
      "cough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are\n",
      "much too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "“Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,” eagerly rejoined Mrs.\n",
      "Elton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and nodding\n",
      "significantly—“there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\n",
      "I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\n",
      "(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\n",
      "bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and\n",
      "from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to\n",
      "accept such an accommodation.”\n",
      "“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my early\n",
      "walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\n",
      "somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\n",
      "scarcely ever had a bad morning before.”\n",
      "“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\n",
      "(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\n",
      "without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\n",
      "myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\n",
      "meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\n",
      "settled.”\n",
      "“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to\n",
      "such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the\n",
      "errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is\n",
      "when I am not here, by my grandmama’s.”\n",
      "“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to\n",
      "employ our men.”\n",
      "Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\n",
      "answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\n",
      "“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.—“The\n",
      "regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\n",
      "and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”\n",
      "“It is certainly very well regulated.”\n",
      "“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a\n",
      "letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\n",
      "kingdom, is even carried wrong—and not one in a million, I suppose,\n",
      "actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\n",
      "hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.”\n",
      "“The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness\n",
      "of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\n",
      "explanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it. That is the\n",
      "key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\n",
      "observations made.\n",
      "“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the same sort of\n",
      "handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\n",
      "teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\n",
      "the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have\n",
      "very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand\n",
      "they can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I\n",
      "have not always known their writing apart.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I know what\n",
      "you mean—but Emma’s hand is the strongest.”\n",
      "“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse; “and\n",
      "always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with half a sigh and half a\n",
      "smile at her.\n",
      "“I never saw any gentleman’s handwriting”—Emma began, looking also at\n",
      "Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\n",
      "to some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect, “Now, how am I\n",
      "going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\n",
      "before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\n",
      "phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend—your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that\n",
      "would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.—No, I can pronounce\n",
      "his name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\n",
      "better.—Now for it.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—“Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "writes one of the best gentleman’s hands I ever saw.”\n",
      "“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too small—wants\n",
      "strength. It is like a woman’s writing.”\n",
      "This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\n",
      "the base aspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a\n",
      "large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston\n",
      "any letter about her to produce?” No, she had heard from him very\n",
      "lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.\n",
      "“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my writing-desk, I\n",
      "am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.—Do not you\n",
      "remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?”\n",
      "“He chose to say he was employed”—\n",
      "“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\n",
      "Mr. Knightley.”\n",
      "“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,” said Mr.\n",
      "Knightley dryly, “writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will,\n",
      "of course, put forth his best.”\n",
      "Dinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\n",
      "ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\n",
      "allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying—\n",
      "“Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.”\n",
      "Jane’s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\n",
      "She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\n",
      "the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\n",
      "_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in\n",
      "full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had\n",
      "not been in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness\n",
      "than usual—a glow both of complexion and spirits.\n",
      "She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\n",
      "expense of the Irish mails;—it was at her tongue’s end—but she\n",
      "abstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should\n",
      "hurt Jane Fairfax’s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of\n",
      "the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming\n",
      "to the beauty and grace of each.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVII\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\n",
      "it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with\n",
      "so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\n",
      "Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be\n",
      "almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\n",
      "left them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon\n",
      "began again; and though much that passed between them was in a\n",
      "half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton’s side, there was no avoiding a\n",
      "knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office—catching\n",
      "cold—fetching letters—and friendship, were long under discussion; and\n",
      "to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to\n",
      "Jane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\n",
      "suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton’s meditated activity.\n",
      "“Here is April come!” said she, “I get quite anxious about you. June\n",
      "will soon be here.”\n",
      "“But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked\n",
      "forward to the summer in general.”\n",
      "“But have you really heard of nothing?”\n",
      "“I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.”\n",
      "“Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\n",
      "difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.”\n",
      "“I not aware!” said Jane, shaking her head; “dear Mrs. Elton, who can\n",
      "have thought of it as I have done?”\n",
      "“But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\n",
      "how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\n",
      "a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\n",
      "Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\n",
      "body was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first\n",
      "circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable!\n",
      "Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge’s is the one I would most wish\n",
      "to see you in.”\n",
      "“Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,” said\n",
      "Jane. “I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\n",
      "it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\n",
      "not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.”\n",
      "“Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\n",
      "trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\n",
      "more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\n",
      "a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\n",
      "for any thing eligible.”\n",
      "“Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;\n",
      "till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\n",
      "trouble.”\n",
      "“But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\n",
      "or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\n",
      "us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you\n",
      "deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday\n",
      "occurrence, is not obtained at a moment’s notice; indeed, indeed, we\n",
      "must begin inquiring directly.”\n",
      "“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\n",
      "inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.\n",
      "When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of\n",
      "being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\n",
      "would soon produce something—Offices for the sale—not quite of human\n",
      "flesh—but of human intellect.”\n",
      "“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\n",
      "the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend\n",
      "to the abolition.”\n",
      "“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane;\n",
      "“governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\n",
      "different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\n",
      "the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I\n",
      "only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\n",
      "applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\n",
      "something that would do.”\n",
      "“Something that would do!” repeated Mrs. Elton. “Aye, _that_ may suit\n",
      "your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are;\n",
      "but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\n",
      "thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\n",
      "not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\n",
      "life.”\n",
      "“You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it\n",
      "would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\n",
      "think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\n",
      "A gentleman’s family is all that I should condition for.”\n",
      "“I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\n",
      "be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\n",
      "on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\n",
      "first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\n",
      "your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\n",
      "as much as you chose;—that is—I do not know—if you knew the harp, you\n",
      "might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;—yes, I\n",
      "really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you\n",
      "chose;—and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\n",
      "comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.”\n",
      "“You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a\n",
      "situation together,” said Jane, “they are pretty sure to be equal;\n",
      "however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at\n",
      "present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\n",
      "obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\n",
      "nothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\n",
      "shall remain where I am, and as I am.”\n",
      "“And I am quite serious too, I assure you,” replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\n",
      "“in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\n",
      "watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.”\n",
      "In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of\n",
      "object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\n",
      "“Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of his\n",
      "gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he\n",
      "is;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\n",
      "old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\n",
      "modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\n",
      "you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\n",
      "began to think my cara sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am\n",
      "rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\n",
      "it?—Selina’s choice—handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is\n",
      "not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\n",
      "over-trimmed—quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\n",
      "now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\n",
      "a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of\n",
      "dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\n",
      "minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show\n",
      "and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\n",
      "trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\n",
      "look well?”\n",
      "The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\n",
      "Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late\n",
      "dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too\n",
      "much expected by the best judges, for surprize—but there was great joy.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been\n",
      "sorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute\n",
      "astonishment.—That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at\n",
      "home after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk\n",
      "half a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being in mixed\n",
      "company till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility\n",
      "and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A\n",
      "man who had been in motion since eight o’clock in the morning, and\n",
      "might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have\n",
      "been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been\n",
      "alone!—Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own\n",
      "fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again\n",
      "into the world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\n",
      "back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\n",
      "probably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley looked\n",
      "at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, “I could\n",
      "not have believed it even of _him_.”\n",
      "Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\n",
      "exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\n",
      "principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\n",
      "making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\n",
      "inquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\n",
      "her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\n",
      "abroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\n",
      "communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\n",
      "had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\n",
      "the room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\n",
      "had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\n",
      "“Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few\n",
      "lines—will not take you long; read it to Emma.”\n",
      "The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\n",
      "to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible\n",
      "to every body.\n",
      "“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\n",
      "to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?—Anne,\n",
      "my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?—In\n",
      "town next week, you see—at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\n",
      "impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\n",
      "likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\n",
      "nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\n",
      "again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\n",
      "and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\n",
      "Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\n",
      "it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\n",
      "other time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\n",
      "circumstance to the others in a common way.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and\n",
      "words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\n",
      "happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm\n",
      "and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little\n",
      "occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the\n",
      "degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\n",
      "Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\n",
      "to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\n",
      "and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\n",
      "communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\n",
      "It was well that he took every body’s joy for granted, or he might not\n",
      "have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\n",
      "delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\n",
      "be made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\n",
      "she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\n",
      "been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\n",
      "Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the\n",
      "subject with her.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVIII\n",
      "“I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,”\n",
      "said Mr. Weston.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\n",
      "her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\n",
      "“You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,” he\n",
      "continued—“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.”\n",
      "“Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\n",
      "Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\n",
      "pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.”\n",
      "“You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.— He\n",
      "is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\n",
      "letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\n",
      "son’s hand, presumed to open it—though it was not directed to me—it was\n",
      "to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\n",
      "hardly ever get a letter.”\n",
      "“And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\n",
      "Weston—(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most\n",
      "dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours\n",
      "follow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\n",
      "married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\n",
      "not have believed it of you!”\n",
      "“Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\n",
      "Elton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry,\n",
      "merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to\n",
      "town directly, on Mrs. Churchill’s account—she has not been well the\n",
      "whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to\n",
      "move southward without loss of time.”\n",
      "“Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?”\n",
      "“Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\n",
      "considerable journey.”\n",
      "“Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\n",
      "from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\n",
      "of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\n",
      "Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me—but twice\n",
      "in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\n",
      "horses.”\n",
      "“The evil of the distance from Enscombe,” said Mr. Weston, “is, that\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\n",
      "sofa for a week together. In Frank’s last letter she complained, he\n",
      "said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\n",
      "both his arm and his uncle’s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\n",
      "weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\n",
      "sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word. Certainly,\n",
      "delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\n",
      "must grant me that.”\n",
      "“No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\n",
      "own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a formidable\n",
      "antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—and I assure you,\n",
      "if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\n",
      "would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill’s making incredible exertions to\n",
      "avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her—and I believe I have\n",
      "caught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\n",
      "an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?”\n",
      "“Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\n",
      "lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the\n",
      "land for”—\n",
      "Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\n",
      "“Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\n",
      "you. Do not run away with such an idea.”\n",
      "“Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\n",
      "a fine lady as any body ever beheld.”\n",
      "Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\n",
      "It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\n",
      "_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\n",
      "it;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\n",
      "Weston went on.\n",
      "“Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but\n",
      "this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\n",
      "therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\n",
      "now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I\n",
      "would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith\n",
      "in Mrs. Churchill’s illness.”\n",
      "“If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath, or to\n",
      "Clifton?” “She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\n",
      "her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\n",
      "been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\n",
      "begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\n",
      "retired.”\n",
      "“Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\n",
      "the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\n",
      "seem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—And\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\n",
      "that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough\n",
      "in herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman\n",
      "cannot have too many resources—and I feel very thankful that I have so\n",
      "many myself as to be quite independent of society.”\n",
      "“Frank was here in February for a fortnight.”\n",
      "“So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\n",
      "of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\n",
      "myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\n",
      "such a creature in the world.”\n",
      "This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\n",
      "Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\n",
      "“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing\n",
      "possible. Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston’s letters lately have\n",
      "been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.”\n",
      "He had done his duty and could return to his son.\n",
      "“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we\n",
      "might see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome. It has\n",
      "been completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\n",
      "he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\n",
      "up—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\n",
      "desponding. ‘How could he contrive to come? And how could it be\n",
      "supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—I\n",
      "always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has,\n",
      "you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if\n",
      "things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”\n",
      "“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say\n",
      "to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,\n",
      "because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the\n",
      "rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and\n",
      "exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen’s\n",
      "saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to\n",
      "dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The\n",
      "carriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning, I\n",
      "remember, he came to me quite in despair.”\n",
      "She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\n",
      "seized the opportunity of going on.\n",
      "“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is\n",
      "ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\n",
      "Enscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\n",
      "prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring—precisely the\n",
      "season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\n",
      "the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\n",
      "never too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\n",
      "of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there\n",
      "always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\n",
      "intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\n",
      "do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\n",
      "sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\n",
      "to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\n",
      "having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\n",
      "state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\n",
      "pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\n",
      "thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s\n",
      "partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\n",
      "gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.”\n",
      "“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\n",
      "will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\n",
      "Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\n",
      "of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means\n",
      "implicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,\n",
      "so I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer.”\n",
      "Mr. Weston was musing.\n",
      "“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\n",
      "there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me\n",
      "to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be\n",
      "ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the\n",
      "treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of\n",
      "it is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank’s mother would\n",
      "never have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has\n",
      "pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife’s: his is a quiet,\n",
      "indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only\n",
      "make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance\n",
      "and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair\n",
      "pretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely\n",
      "the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a\n",
      "Churchill she has out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims:\n",
      "but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.”\n",
      "“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a\n",
      "horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\n",
      "people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\n",
      "are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\n",
      "themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\n",
      "directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\n",
      "encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense\n",
      "airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established\n",
      "families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived\n",
      "at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came\n",
      "from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.\n",
      "Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is\n",
      "something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of\n",
      "the Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\n",
      "yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my\n",
      "brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\n",
      "neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\n",
      "years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him—I\n",
      "believe, at least—I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\n",
      "the purchase before his death.”\n",
      "They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\n",
      "said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\n",
      "After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\n",
      "and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\n",
      "little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\n",
      "nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of\n",
      "spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\n",
      "leave them early the next day; and he soon began with—\n",
      "“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\n",
      "boys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at\n",
      "full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise\n",
      "than her’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have\n",
      "to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall do all in\n",
      "my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\n",
      "happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”\n",
      "“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”\n",
      "“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”\n",
      "“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even\n",
      "may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue\n",
      "to increase as much as they have done lately.”\n",
      "“Increase!”\n",
      "“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\n",
      "great difference in your way of life.”\n",
      "“Difference! No indeed I am not.”\n",
      "“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\n",
      "than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for\n",
      "only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—When did it\n",
      "happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,\n",
      "and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella\n",
      "brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole’s, or balls\n",
      "at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in\n",
      "your goings-on, is very great.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it all.”\n",
      "“Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\n",
      "influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\n",
      "that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I\n",
      "only beg you to send them home.”\n",
      "“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence. Let them\n",
      "be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”\n",
      "“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like to know\n",
      "how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\n",
      "of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\n",
      "to attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine—what\n",
      "have they been? Dining once with the Coles—and having a ball talked of,\n",
      "which never took place. I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\n",
      "once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning\n",
      "to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours\n",
      "from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for\n",
      "me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that\n",
      "if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much\n",
      "better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours\n",
      "where she is absent one—and who, when he is at home, is either reading\n",
      "to himself or settling his accounts.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\n",
      "difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton’s beginning to talk to him.\n",
      "VOLUME III\n",
      "CHAPTER I\n",
      "A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\n",
      "nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\n",
      "was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\n",
      "apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\n",
      "really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but\n",
      "if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\n",
      "two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he\n",
      "had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\n",
      "months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\n",
      "her:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did not\n",
      "mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\n",
      "incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\n",
      "She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\n",
      "That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\n",
      "acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\n",
      "decisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\n",
      "crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and\n",
      "tranquil state.\n",
      "It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had\n",
      "foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank\n",
      "Churchill’s feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so\n",
      "soon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.\n",
      "He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he\n",
      "came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise\n",
      "all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was\n",
      "influenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost\n",
      "friendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing\n",
      "her. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\n",
      "had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. She\n",
      "watched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had\n",
      "been. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had\n",
      "produced this very natural and very desirable effect.\n",
      "He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\n",
      "delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and\n",
      "he was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\n",
      "his comparative indifference. He was not calm; his spirits were\n",
      "evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he\n",
      "was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what\n",
      "decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an\n",
      "hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. “He had seen a\n",
      "group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed—he had not\n",
      "stopped, he would not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity\n",
      "to think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he\n",
      "wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.” She had no\n",
      "doubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits,\n",
      "nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather\n",
      "inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a\n",
      "discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.\n",
      "This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\n",
      "He was often hoping, intending to come—but was always prevented. His\n",
      "aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\n",
      "Randall’s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\n",
      "to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill’s removal to London had been of no\n",
      "service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\n",
      "really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,\n",
      "at Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he\n",
      "looked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been\n",
      "half a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that\n",
      "care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have\n",
      "many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,\n",
      "by all his father’s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely\n",
      "imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.\n",
      "It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not\n",
      "endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\n",
      "suffering; and by the ten days’ end, her nephew’s letter to Randalls\n",
      "communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\n",
      "Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\n",
      "an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\n",
      "ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\n",
      "expected from the change.\n",
      "Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\n",
      "and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\n",
      "before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the\n",
      "house was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\n",
      "the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\n",
      "could even wish.\n",
      "Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\n",
      "considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\n",
      "hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\n",
      "Mr. Weston’s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It\n",
      "was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\n",
      "really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a\n",
      "young man?—An hour’s ride. He would be always coming over. The\n",
      "difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\n",
      "the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\n",
      "miles—nay, eighteen—it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street—was a\n",
      "serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent\n",
      "in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London;\n",
      "he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for\n",
      "easy intercourse. Better than nearer!\n",
      "One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\n",
      "removal,—the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but\n",
      "it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\n",
      "however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\n",
      "very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines\n",
      "from Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the\n",
      "change, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for\n",
      "twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a\n",
      "day as possible.\n",
      "Mr. Weston’s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\n",
      "between the young people of Highbury and happiness.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\n",
      "May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\n",
      "spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\n",
      "hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have\n",
      "any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\n",
      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\n",
      "the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\n",
      "Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\n",
      "before dinner, and every thing was safe.\n",
      "No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at\n",
      "the Crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common\n",
      "meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\n",
      "entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\n",
      "for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort\n",
      "of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse\n",
      "him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man’s\n",
      "company. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good\n",
      "time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\n",
      "Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\n",
      "say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\n",
      "They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it\n",
      "should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of\n",
      "another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,\n",
      "without great surprize. “So unreasonably early!” she was going to\n",
      "exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,\n",
      "who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.\n",
      "Weston’s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another\n",
      "carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same\n",
      "distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if\n",
      "half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of\n",
      "preparatory inspection.\n",
      "Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.\n",
      "Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a\n",
      "man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\n",
      "distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a\n",
      "little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\n",
      "character.—General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man\n",
      "what he ought to be.—She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked\n",
      "about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to\n",
      "do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\n",
      "various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a\n",
      "fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\n",
      "Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston’s fault that the number of privy\n",
      "councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates’s door\n",
      "to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\n",
      "brought by the Eltons.\n",
      "Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\n",
      "which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\n",
      "the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,—impatient\n",
      "to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he. “I\n",
      "have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\n",
      "It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.”\n",
      "A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\n",
      "said,\n",
      "“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\n",
      "either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.”\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\n",
      "passed.\n",
      "“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about. “We\n",
      "thought you were to bring them.”\n",
      "The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\n",
      "longed to know what Frank’s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\n",
      "he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\n",
      "graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\n",
      "by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\n",
      "In a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of rain.—“I\n",
      "will see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank to his father:\n",
      "“Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. Weston was\n",
      "following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\n",
      "of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\n",
      "though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\n",
      "“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\n",
      "I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\n",
      "pleased with him.—You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a\n",
      "very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\n",
      "approve—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\n",
      "You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them.\n",
      "They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me\n",
      "had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\n",
      "cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\n",
      "much better.”\n",
      "While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston’s attention was chained; but\n",
      "when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\n",
      "just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our\n",
      "carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\n",
      "extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a\n",
      "pleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you\n",
      "were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite\n",
      "unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.”\n",
      "Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\n",
      "the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\n",
      "Weston’s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be\n",
      "understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every\n",
      "body’s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,\n",
      "who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes\n",
      "after her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door\n",
      "opened she was heard,\n",
      "“So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\n",
      "care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—Well!—(as soon as\n",
      "she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!—This is\n",
      "admirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\n",
      "not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane, Jane, look!—did you\n",
      "ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin’s\n",
      "lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\n",
      "I came in; she was standing in the entrance. ‘Oh! Mrs. Stokes,’ said\n",
      "I—but I had not time for more.” She was now met by Mrs. Weston.—“Very\n",
      "well, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\n",
      "it. So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often,\n",
      "and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it\n",
      "indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the\n",
      "carriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the\n",
      "horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our\n",
      "thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most\n",
      "kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in\n",
      "one day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my\n",
      "word, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse’s. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings are not\n",
      "warm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon’s wedding-present.—So kind of her\n",
      "to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know—Mr. Dixon’s choice.\n",
      "There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some\n",
      "time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you\n",
      "sure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so\n",
      "afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to\n",
      "step upon—I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill, I must tell you my mother’s spectacles have never been in\n",
      "fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\n",
      "your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill?—Ah! here’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you\n",
      "do?—Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in\n",
      "fairy-land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing\n",
      "Emma most complacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, you do look—how do you like Jane’s hair?—You are a\n",
      "judge.—She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\n",
      "hair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I\n",
      "declare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\n",
      "moment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This is\n",
      "delightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there he is. Don’t\n",
      "disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do\n",
      "you do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the\n",
      "town—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss\n",
      "Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do\n",
      "you do? How do you all do?—Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never\n",
      "better.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the\n",
      "worthy Coles.—Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among\n",
      "such friends! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I\n",
      "thank you, for me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir,\n",
      "by and bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!”\n",
      "Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\n",
      "Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\n",
      "discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little\n",
      "way behind her.—He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she\n",
      "could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress\n",
      "and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was\n",
      "evidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was, “How do you\n",
      "like my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my\n",
      "hair?”—with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\n",
      "politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, “Nobody can think less of dress in\n",
      "general than I do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s\n",
      "eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons—who I have\n",
      "no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—I would not wish\n",
      "to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\n",
      "mine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.—We shall\n",
      "see if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\n",
      "I like him very well.”\n",
      "At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\n",
      "but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\n",
      "more;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\n",
      "another suspension brought Mrs. Elton’s tones again distinctly\n",
      "forward.—Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\n",
      "“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—I was\n",
      "this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\n",
      "tidings of us.”\n",
      "“Jane!”—repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\n",
      "displeasure.—“That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\n",
      "suppose.”\n",
      "“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.\n",
      "“Not at all.”\n",
      "“You are ungrateful.”\n",
      "“Ungrateful!—What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to a\n",
      "smile—“No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is\n",
      "my father?—When are we to begin dancing?”\n",
      "Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\n",
      "off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\n",
      "laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\n",
      "must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\n",
      "interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.—Emma\n",
      "heard the sad truth with fortitude.\n",
      "“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr. Weston.\n",
      "“She will think Frank ought to ask her.”\n",
      "Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\n",
      "boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\n",
      "perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\n",
      "was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.—Mr.\n",
      "Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was\n",
      "almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly\n",
      "the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though\n",
      "she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by\n",
      "the change. Mr. Weston might be his son’s superior.—In spite of this\n",
      "little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see\n",
      "the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that\n",
      "she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.—She was more\n",
      "disturbed by Mr. Knightley’s not dancing than by any thing else.—There\n",
      "he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be\n",
      "dancing,—not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and\n",
      "whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance\n",
      "till their rubbers were made up,—so young as he looked!—He could not\n",
      "have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had\n",
      "placed himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms\n",
      "and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must\n",
      "draw every body’s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not\n",
      "one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—He\n",
      "moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in\n",
      "how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have\n",
      "danced, would he but take the trouble.—Whenever she caught his eye, she\n",
      "forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he\n",
      "could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.—He\n",
      "seemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he\n",
      "thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she\n",
      "did not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and\n",
      "her partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.\n",
      "That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was\n",
      "indubitable.\n",
      "The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\n",
      "attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\n",
      "happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\n",
      "bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\n",
      "the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\n",
      "recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings\n",
      "usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something\n",
      "of.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\n",
      "partner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been\n",
      "hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one\n",
      "disengaged was the wonder!—But Emma’s wonder lessened soon afterwards,\n",
      "on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance\n",
      "if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she\n",
      "was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.\n",
      "Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room\n",
      "where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in\n",
      "front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of\n",
      "maintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss\n",
      "Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.—Emma saw it. She was\n",
      "not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had\n",
      "therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little\n",
      "she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were\n",
      "exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;\n",
      "but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue\n",
      "which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she\n",
      "perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was\n",
      "not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant\n",
      "glances.—The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join\n",
      "him and say, “Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply\n",
      "was, “Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”\n",
      "“Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\n",
      "dancer.”\n",
      "“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great\n",
      "pleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\n",
      "married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\n",
      "great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\n",
      "Gilbert.”\n",
      "“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\n",
      "disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.” “Miss\n",
      "Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—and if I were\n",
      "not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You\n",
      "will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\n",
      "command—but my dancing days are over.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\n",
      "mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton!\n",
      "the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.—She looked round for a moment;\n",
      "he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging\n",
      "himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed\n",
      "between him and his wife.\n",
      "She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\n",
      "face might be as hot.\n",
      "In another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr. Knightley leading\n",
      "Harriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\n",
      "delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\n",
      "both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\n",
      "too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\n",
      "catch his eye again.\n",
      "His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\n",
      "and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\n",
      "the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\n",
      "and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\n",
      "announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\n",
      "flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\n",
      "Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\n",
      "foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\n",
      "growing very like her;—_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\n",
      "audibly to her partner,\n",
      "“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good-natured,\n",
      "I declare.”\n",
      "Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard\n",
      "from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table\n",
      "and taking up her spoon.\n",
      "“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there\n",
      "will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—One\n",
      "door nailed up—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr.\n",
      "Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!—so\n",
      "gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\n",
      "said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody\n",
      "missed me.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\n",
      "Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\n",
      "vast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\n",
      "and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of\n",
      "her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\n",
      "amused, and who were your partners. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not\n",
      "forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love\n",
      "to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.\n",
      "Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’\n",
      "My dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not\n",
      "rather?—I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane\n",
      "on one arm, and me on the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little\n",
      "back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she\n",
      "looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen\n",
      "of the evening!—Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take\n",
      "care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded\n",
      "there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there\n",
      "is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and\n",
      "style—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,\n",
      "Jane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits,\n",
      "excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of\n",
      "sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all\n",
      "out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread\n",
      "and asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would\n",
      "not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is\n",
      "brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!—Such\n",
      "elegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since—Well, where\n",
      "shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a\n",
      "draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this\n",
      "side?—Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill—only it seems too good—but just as\n",
      "you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane,\n",
      "how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too!\n",
      "Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent,\n",
      "and I cannot help beginning.”\n",
      "Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\n",
      "but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him\n",
      "irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\n",
      "reprobation of Mr. Elton’s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\n",
      "and Mrs. Elton’s looks also received the due share of censure.\n",
      "“They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,” said he. “Emma, why is it\n",
      "that they are your enemies?”\n",
      "He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\n",
      "“_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\n",
      "be.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\n",
      "that you did want him to marry Harriet.”\n",
      "“I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.”\n",
      "He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\n",
      "only said,\n",
      "“I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.”\n",
      "“Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell\n",
      "me I am wrong?”\n",
      "“Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong,\n",
      "I am sure the other tells you of it.”\n",
      "“I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There\n",
      "is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not:\n",
      "and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was\n",
      "through a series of strange blunders!”\n",
      "“And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\n",
      "justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\n",
      "chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\n",
      "Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\n",
      "girl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\n",
      "woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.”\n",
      "Emma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the bustle of\n",
      "Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\n",
      "“Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\n",
      "doing?—Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\n",
      "Every body is asleep!”\n",
      "“I am ready,” said Emma, “whenever I am wanted.”\n",
      "“Whom are you going to dance with?” asked Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "She hesitated a moment, and then replied, “With you, if you will ask\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.\n",
      "“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\n",
      "not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.”\n",
      "“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”\n",
      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\n",
      "pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\n",
      "she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.—She was extremely\n",
      "glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\n",
      "Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\n",
      "alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\n",
      "peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\n",
      "minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\n",
      "occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\n",
      "to another happy result—the cure of Harriet’s infatuation.—From\n",
      "Harriet’s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted\n",
      "the ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were\n",
      "suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the\n",
      "superior creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma\n",
      "could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by\n",
      "injurious courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\n",
      "supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\n",
      "requisite.—Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\n",
      "Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\n",
      "must be before her!\n",
      "She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that\n",
      "he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he\n",
      "was to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\n",
      "Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them\n",
      "all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened\n",
      "up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their\n",
      "grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons\n",
      "entered whom she had never less expected to see together—Frank\n",
      "Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm—actually Harriet!—A moment\n",
      "sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\n",
      "Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer\n",
      "her.—The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards\n",
      "asunder;—they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately\n",
      "sinking into a chair fainted away.\n",
      "A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\n",
      "and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\n",
      "suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\n",
      "with the whole.\n",
      "Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard’s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\n",
      "taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\n",
      "for safety, had led them into alarm.—About half a mile beyond Highbury,\n",
      "making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\n",
      "for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had\n",
      "advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\n",
      "distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\n",
      "party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\n",
      "Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and\n",
      "calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight\n",
      "hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to\n",
      "Highbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much\n",
      "from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\n",
      "brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in\n",
      "this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\n",
      "How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\n",
      "courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\n",
      "not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen\n",
      "children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and\n",
      "impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.—More and more\n",
      "frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her\n",
      "purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to\n",
      "use her ill.—She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was\n",
      "moving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was\n",
      "followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\n",
      "In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\n",
      "conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\n",
      "leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\n",
      "at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\n",
      "him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\n",
      "a mile or two beyond Highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of\n",
      "scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\n",
      "restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\n",
      "few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on\n",
      "foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\n",
      "terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\n",
      "their own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\n",
      "eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\n",
      "enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It\n",
      "was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\n",
      "place.\n",
      "This was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and of\n",
      "Harriet’s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—He dared\n",
      "not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not\n",
      "another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\n",
      "safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\n",
      "in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the\n",
      "grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\n",
      "Such an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman\n",
      "thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\n",
      "ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\n",
      "least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\n",
      "have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\n",
      "heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\n",
      "at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?—How much\n",
      "more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\n",
      "foresight!—especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\n",
      "mind had already made.\n",
      "It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\n",
      "occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\n",
      "rencontre, no alarm of the kind;—and now it had happened to the very\n",
      "person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\n",
      "to pass by to rescue her!—It certainly was very extraordinary!—And\n",
      "knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\n",
      "period, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\n",
      "attachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr.\n",
      "Elton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most\n",
      "interesting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence\n",
      "should not be strongly recommending each to the other.\n",
      "In the few minutes’ conversation which she had yet had with him, while\n",
      "Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her\n",
      "naïveté, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\n",
      "sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet’s own\n",
      "account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\n",
      "abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing\n",
      "was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\n",
      "She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\n",
      "interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive\n",
      "scheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account\n",
      "proceed.\n",
      "Emma’s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\n",
      "what had passed,—aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\n",
      "she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\n",
      "it was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\n",
      "who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\n",
      "the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last\n",
      "night’s ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as\n",
      "he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without\n",
      "their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some\n",
      "comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "(for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well\n",
      "as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\n",
      "the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\n",
      "indifferent—which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\n",
      "and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\n",
      "an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for\n",
      "she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\n",
      "illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\n",
      "The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\n",
      "themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\n",
      "walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\n",
      "dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\n",
      "nephews:—in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\n",
      "John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\n",
      "gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\n",
      "slightest particular from the original recital.\n",
      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\n",
      "morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\n",
      "and hesitating, thus began:\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I should\n",
      "like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you know, it\n",
      "will be over.”\n",
      "Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\n",
      "seriousness in Harriet’s manner which prepared her, quite as much as\n",
      "her words, for something more than ordinary.\n",
      "“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued, “to have\n",
      "no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\n",
      "creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the\n",
      "satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\n",
      "necessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\n",
      "I dare say you understand me.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Emma, “I hope I do.”\n",
      "“How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...” cried Harriet,\n",
      "warmly. “It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\n",
      "in him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not—except that of the\n",
      "two I had rather not see him—and indeed I would go any distance round\n",
      "to avoid him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\n",
      "her nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\n",
      "all that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall\n",
      "never forget her look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together,\n",
      "it will not give me another moment’s pang: and to convince you that I\n",
      "have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to\n",
      "have destroyed long ago—what I ought never to have kept—I know that\n",
      "very well (blushing as she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it\n",
      "all—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\n",
      "may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\n",
      "holds?” said she, with a conscious look.\n",
      "“Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing?”\n",
      "“No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\n",
      "very much.”\n",
      "She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\n",
      "_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\n",
      "Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\n",
      "abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which\n",
      "Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\n",
      "excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\n",
      "“Now,” said Harriet, “you _must_ recollect.”\n",
      "“No, indeed I do not.”\n",
      "“Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\n",
      "passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\n",
      "times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my\n",
      "sore throat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came—I think the\n",
      "very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\n",
      "penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none\n",
      "about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\n",
      "mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\n",
      "cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before\n",
      "he gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help\n",
      "making a treasure of it—so I put it by never to be used, and looked at\n",
      "it now and then as a great treat.”\n",
      "“My dearest Harriet!” cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and\n",
      "jumping up, “you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\n",
      "Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\n",
      "relic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the\n",
      "finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about\n",
      "me!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my\n",
      "pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual\n",
      "blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on—what\n",
      "else?”\n",
      "“And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\n",
      "it, you did it so naturally.”\n",
      "“And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!”\n",
      "said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\n",
      "between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, “Lord\n",
      "bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\n",
      "piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\n",
      "never was equal to this.”\n",
      "“Here,” resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, “here is something\n",
      "still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\n",
      "this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\n",
      "never did.”\n",
      "Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of\n",
      "an old pencil,—the part without any lead.\n",
      "“This was really his,” said Harriet.—“Do not you remember one\n",
      "morning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I forget exactly\n",
      "the day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\n",
      "_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\n",
      "about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\n",
      "brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\n",
      "his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\n",
      "it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\n",
      "table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\n",
      "dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.”\n",
      "“I do remember it,” cried Emma; “I perfectly remember it.—Talking about\n",
      "spruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and\n",
      "Mr. Elton’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly\n",
      "remember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I\n",
      "have an idea he was standing just here.”\n",
      "“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I cannot\n",
      "recollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\n",
      "am now.”—\n",
      "“Well, go on.”\n",
      "“Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say—except that\n",
      "I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to\n",
      "see me do it.”\n",
      "“My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\n",
      "treasuring up these things?”\n",
      "“Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\n",
      "could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\n",
      "know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but\n",
      "had not resolution enough to part with them.”\n",
      "“But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I have not a\n",
      "word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\n",
      "useful.”\n",
      "“I shall be happier to burn it,” replied Harriet. “It has a\n",
      "disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes,\n",
      "and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.”\n",
      "“And when,” thought Emma, “will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?”\n",
      "She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\n",
      "already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\n",
      "_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet’s.—About a\n",
      "fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and\n",
      "quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which\n",
      "made the information she received more valuable. She merely said, in\n",
      "the course of some trivial chat, “Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I\n",
      "would advise you to do so and so”—and thought no more of it, till after\n",
      "a minute’s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, “I\n",
      "shall never marry.”\n",
      "Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\n",
      "moment’s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not,\n",
      "replied,\n",
      "“Never marry!—This is a new resolution.”\n",
      "“It is one that I shall never change, however.”\n",
      "After another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from—I hope\n",
      "it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?”\n",
      "“Mr. Elton indeed!” cried Harriet indignantly.—“Oh! no”—and Emma could\n",
      "just catch the words, “so superior to Mr. Elton!”\n",
      "She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\n",
      "farther?—should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?—Perhaps\n",
      "Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she\n",
      "were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to\n",
      "hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had\n",
      "been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she\n",
      "was perfectly resolved.—She believed it would be wiser for her to say\n",
      "and know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was\n",
      "always best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,\n",
      "on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have\n",
      "the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.—She was\n",
      "decided, and thus spoke—\n",
      "“Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\n",
      "resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\n",
      "an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly\n",
      "your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?”\n",
      "“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose—\n",
      "Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\n",
      "distance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\n",
      "the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\n",
      "proper, in me especially.”\n",
      "“I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\n",
      "was enough to warm your heart.”\n",
      "“Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very\n",
      "recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time—when I saw him\n",
      "coming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one\n",
      "moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!”\n",
      "“It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.—Yes,\n",
      "honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it\n",
      "will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\n",
      "advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for\n",
      "its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\n",
      "wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\n",
      "let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\n",
      "observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\n",
      "give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\n",
      "the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\n",
      "know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were\n",
      "very wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no\n",
      "doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious\n",
      "nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there\n",
      "have been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I\n",
      "would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured\n",
      "your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I\n",
      "shall always know how to value.”\n",
      "Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\n",
      "very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her\n",
      "friend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must\n",
      "be saving her from the danger of degradation.\n",
      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\n",
      "Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\n",
      "Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\n",
      "to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\n",
      "grandmother’s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was\n",
      "again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was\n",
      "likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she\n",
      "were able to defeat Mrs. Elton’s activity in her service, and save\n",
      "herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her\n",
      "will.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had\n",
      "certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing\n",
      "to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in\n",
      "his pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\n",
      "Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father’s hints, his\n",
      "mother-in-law’s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,\n",
      "discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many\n",
      "were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with\n",
      "Jane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of\n",
      "intelligence between them—he thought so at least—symptoms of admiration\n",
      "on his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself\n",
      "to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any\n",
      "of Emma’s errors of imagination. _She_ was not present when the\n",
      "suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and\n",
      "Jane, at the Eltons’; and he had seen a look, more than a single look,\n",
      "at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed\n",
      "somewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not\n",
      "help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations\n",
      "which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\n",
      "“Myself creating what I saw,”\n",
      "brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of\n",
      "private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill\n",
      "and Jane.\n",
      "He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\n",
      "his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he\n",
      "joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,\n",
      "like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\n",
      "weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\n",
      "and her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\n",
      "reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\n",
      "visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\n",
      "and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;\n",
      "and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons\n",
      "listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse’s\n",
      "most obliging invitation.\n",
      "As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on\n",
      "horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.\n",
      "“By the bye,” said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, “what\n",
      "became of Mr. Perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, “I did not know that he ever\n",
      "had any such plan.”\n",
      "“Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.”\n",
      "“Me! impossible!”\n",
      "“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was\n",
      "certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\n",
      "extremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\n",
      "thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\n",
      "must remember it now?”\n",
      "“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”\n",
      "“Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must have\n",
      "dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk as if you\n",
      "were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”\n",
      "“What is this?—What is this?” cried Mr. Weston, “about Perry and a\n",
      "carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he\n",
      "can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?”\n",
      "“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it from\n",
      "nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston’s having\n",
      "mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with\n",
      "all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\n",
      "it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I\n",
      "dream of every body at Highbury when I am away—and when I have gone\n",
      "through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Perry.”\n",
      "“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should have had such\n",
      "a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\n",
      "should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry’s setting up his carriage! and\n",
      "his wife’s persuading him to it, out of care for his health—just what\n",
      "will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\n",
      "premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\n",
      "And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your\n",
      "dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are\n",
      "absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?”\n",
      "Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\n",
      "prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of\n",
      "Mr. Weston’s hint.\n",
      "“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\n",
      "to be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,\n",
      "there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I do not mean\n",
      "to say that he did not dream it—I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\n",
      "dreams in the world—but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\n",
      "that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\n",
      "mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\n",
      "ourselves—but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\n",
      "thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\n",
      "have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\n",
      "because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don’t you remember\n",
      "grandmama’s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had\n",
      "been walking to—very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\n",
      "Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed I\n",
      "do not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\n",
      "she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\n",
      "beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\n",
      "I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\n",
      "never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing\n",
      "before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and\n",
      "now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not\n",
      "like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the\n",
      "least thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh! just behind. Perfectly\n",
      "remember Mrs. Perry’s coming.—Extraordinary dream, indeed!”\n",
      "They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley’s eyes had preceded Miss\n",
      "Bates’s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill’s face, where he\n",
      "thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\n",
      "involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\n",
      "with her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen\n",
      "waited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\n",
      "Churchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her\n",
      "intently—in vain, however, if it were so—Jane passed between them into\n",
      "the hall, and looked at neither.\n",
      "There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\n",
      "borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\n",
      "the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\n",
      "and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\n",
      "persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on\n",
      "which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea\n",
      "passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\n",
      "him, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away\n",
      "their alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is\n",
      "it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated\n",
      "rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters\n",
      "one morning. I want to puzzle you again.”\n",
      "Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was\n",
      "quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\n",
      "disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\n",
      "for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The\n",
      "quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.\n",
      "Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in\n",
      "lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor\n",
      "little boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter\n",
      "near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\n",
      "Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\n",
      "glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\n",
      "Emma, Jane opposite to them—and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\n",
      "all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\n",
      "apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\n",
      "pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\n",
      "buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\n",
      "looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\n",
      "every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell\n",
      "to work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\n",
      "The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there\n",
      "was a blush on Jane’s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise\n",
      "ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could\n",
      "all be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion\n",
      "of his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must\n",
      "be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed\n",
      "to meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for\n",
      "gallantry and trick. It was a child’s play, chosen to conceal a deeper\n",
      "game on Frank Churchill’s part.\n",
      "With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\n",
      "and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a\n",
      "short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and\n",
      "demure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly\n",
      "entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to\n",
      "appear to censure; for she said, “Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank\n",
      "Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, “I will give it to\n",
      "her—shall I?”—and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing\n",
      "warmth. “No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.”\n",
      "It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\n",
      "feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\n",
      "over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\n",
      "civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley’s excessive curiosity\n",
      "to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\n",
      "for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to\n",
      "be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her\n",
      "comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the\n",
      "superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\n",
      "evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\n",
      "more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not\n",
      "know that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even\n",
      "an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\n",
      "that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\n",
      "attack, and turned towards her aunt.\n",
      "“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\n",
      "a word—“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\n",
      "going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\n",
      "for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\n",
      "night.”\n",
      "Jane’s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\n",
      "preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;\n",
      "but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.\n",
      "Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed\n",
      "towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was\n",
      "afterwards looking for her shawl—Frank Churchill was looking also—it\n",
      "was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley could not tell.\n",
      "He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what\n",
      "he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\n",
      "observations, he must—yes, he certainly must, as a friend—an anxious\n",
      "friend—give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\n",
      "in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\n",
      "his duty.\n",
      "“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\n",
      "poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw\n",
      "the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining\n",
      "to the one, and so very distressing to the other.”\n",
      "Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\n",
      "explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she\n",
      "was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\n",
      "“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere\n",
      "joke among ourselves.”\n",
      "“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and Mr.\n",
      "Churchill.”\n",
      "He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\n",
      "busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\n",
      "doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference—fruitless\n",
      "interference. Emma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed\n",
      "to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to\n",
      "her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome\n",
      "interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather\n",
      "than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\n",
      "“My dear Emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you think\n",
      "you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\n",
      "gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”\n",
      "“Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.—Why\n",
      "do you make a doubt of it?”\n",
      "“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\n",
      "that she admired him?”\n",
      "“Never, never!” she cried with a most open eagerness—“Never, for the\n",
      "twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\n",
      "it possibly come into your head?”\n",
      "“I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\n",
      "them—certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\n",
      "public.”\n",
      "“Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\n",
      "vouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very sorry\n",
      "to check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do. There is no\n",
      "admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\n",
      "have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings\n",
      "rather of a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to\n",
      "explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which is\n",
      "capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\n",
      "from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\n",
      "the world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\n",
      "can _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman’s\n",
      "indifference.”\n",
      "She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which\n",
      "silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\n",
      "prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\n",
      "suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\n",
      "circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\n",
      "hers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\n",
      "irritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\n",
      "fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse’s tender habits required almost\n",
      "every evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\n",
      "leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\n",
      "of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\n",
      "importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\n",
      "present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again\n",
      "restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings’\n",
      "coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\n",
      "whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the\n",
      "situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might\n",
      "eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of\n",
      "all her neighbours was by the approach of it.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\n",
      "of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\n",
      "wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\n",
      "at first;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\n",
      "need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the\n",
      "Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\n",
      "autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\n",
      "to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\n",
      "idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see\n",
      "what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had\n",
      "agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more\n",
      "of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be\n",
      "done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the\n",
      "bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic\n",
      "parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.\n",
      "This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\n",
      "feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.\n",
      "Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and\n",
      "sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go\n",
      "together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it\n",
      "was to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing\n",
      "but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must\n",
      "already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:—it\n",
      "could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain\n",
      "to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an\n",
      "arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an\n",
      "arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of\n",
      "being said to be of Mrs. Elton’s party! Every feeling was offended; and\n",
      "the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of\n",
      "secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr.\n",
      "Weston’s temper.\n",
      "“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very comfortably.\n",
      "“But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\n",
      "numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\n",
      "own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\n",
      "leave her out.”\n",
      "Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\n",
      "It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was\n",
      "growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\n",
      "pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\n",
      "into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\n",
      "before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\n",
      "on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton’s resources were\n",
      "inadequate to such an attack.\n",
      "“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she cried.—“And such weather\n",
      "for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\n",
      "are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.\n",
      "Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\n",
      "exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”\n",
      "“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley. “That may\n",
      "be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are\n",
      "ripening fast.”\n",
      "If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\n",
      "for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like\n",
      "it of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\n",
      "famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\n",
      "but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\n",
      "the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\n",
      "and again to come—much oftener than he doubted—and was extremely\n",
      "gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\n",
      "as she chose to consider it.\n",
      "“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come. Name your\n",
      "day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”\n",
      "“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some others whom\n",
      "I would wish to meet you.”\n",
      "“Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady\n",
      "Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”\n",
      "“I hope you will bring Elton,” said he: “but I will not trouble you to\n",
      "give any other invitations.”\n",
      "“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be afraid\n",
      "of delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\n",
      "Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party.\n",
      "Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests.”\n",
      "“No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world\n",
      "whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\n",
      "that one is—”\n",
      "“—Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\n",
      "“No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such\n",
      "matters myself.”\n",
      "“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one\n",
      "preferred to herself.—“You are a humourist, and may say what you like.\n",
      "Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me—Jane and her\n",
      "aunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\n",
      "the Hartfield family. Don’t scruple. I know you are attached to them.”\n",
      "“You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on\n",
      "Miss Bates in my way home.”\n",
      "“That’s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you like. It is\n",
      "to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\n",
      "shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\n",
      "on my arm. Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\n",
      "more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\n",
      "no form or parade—a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your\n",
      "gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\n",
      "trees;—and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\n",
      "of doors—a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\n",
      "and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?”\n",
      "“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the\n",
      "table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\n",
      "gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\n",
      "best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\n",
      "strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.”\n",
      "“Well—as you please; only don’t have a great set out. And, by the bye,\n",
      "can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be\n",
      "sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to\n",
      "inspect anything—”\n",
      "“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”\n",
      "“Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\n",
      "clever.”\n",
      "“I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\n",
      "would spurn any body’s assistance.”\n",
      "“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\n",
      "donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by. I\n",
      "really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I\n",
      "conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so\n",
      "many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\n",
      "home;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is dust, and in\n",
      "winter there is dirt.”\n",
      "“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane\n",
      "is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however,\n",
      "if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole’s. I would wish every thing\n",
      "to be as much to your taste as possible.”\n",
      "“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\n",
      "Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\n",
      "warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.—Yes,\n",
      "believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\n",
      "the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\n",
      "wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\n",
      "and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat\n",
      "would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\n",
      "specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\n",
      "Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\n",
      "He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him\n",
      "for his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for\n",
      "two years. “Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\n",
      "very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear\n",
      "girls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp\n",
      "now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house\n",
      "again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "and any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all\n",
      "to his, and Emma’s, and Harriet’s going there some very fine morning.\n",
      "He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them—very kind\n",
      "and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body’s most ready concurrence. The\n",
      "invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\n",
      "to themselves.—Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\n",
      "pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over\n",
      "to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which\n",
      "could have been dispensed with.—Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say\n",
      "that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no\n",
      "time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\n",
      "In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\n",
      "Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\n",
      "settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,—the weather appearing\n",
      "exactly right.\n",
      "Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\n",
      "safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\n",
      "this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\n",
      "Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\n",
      "happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\n",
      "had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\n",
      "to heat themselves.—Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\n",
      "purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all\n",
      "the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\n",
      "sympathiser.\n",
      "It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\n",
      "was satisfied of her father’s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and\n",
      "look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more\n",
      "particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds\n",
      "which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\n",
      "She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\n",
      "the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\n",
      "the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\n",
      "characteristic situation, low and sheltered—its ample gardens\n",
      "stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\n",
      "all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight—and its abundance\n",
      "of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\n",
      "had rooted up.—The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\n",
      "it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\n",
      "comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.—It was just what it ought\n",
      "to be, and it looked what it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect\n",
      "for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\n",
      "in blood and understanding.—Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\n",
      "but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\n",
      "neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These\n",
      "were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\n",
      "was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\n",
      "strawberry-beds.—The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\n",
      "Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was\n",
      "very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\n",
      "talking—strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\n",
      "spoken of.—“The best fruit in England—every body’s favourite—always\n",
      "wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather\n",
      "for one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly\n",
      "the best time—never tired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely\n",
      "superior—no comparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very\n",
      "scarce—Chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price of\n",
      "strawberries in London—abundance about Bristol—Maple\n",
      "Grove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking exactly\n",
      "different—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of their\n",
      "way—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to\n",
      "cherries—currants more refreshing—only objection to gathering\n",
      "strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no\n",
      "longer—must go and sit in the shade.”\n",
      "Such, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only once by\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\n",
      "inquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—She had some fears\n",
      "of his horse.\n",
      "Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to\n",
      "overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.—A situation,\n",
      "a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received\n",
      "notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs.\n",
      "Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it\n",
      "fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an\n",
      "acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful,\n",
      "charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every\n",
      "thing—and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\n",
      "immediately.—On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph—and she\n",
      "positively refused to take her friend’s negative, though Miss Fairfax\n",
      "continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\n",
      "thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\n",
      "before.—Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\n",
      "acquiescence by the morrow’s post.—How Jane could bear it at all, was\n",
      "astonishing to Emma.—She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly—and at\n",
      "last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\n",
      "removal.—“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\n",
      "gardens—all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent.”—The\n",
      "pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\n",
      "It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a\n",
      "scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\n",
      "followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of\n",
      "limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the\n",
      "river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.—It led to nothing;\n",
      "nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,\n",
      "which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an\n",
      "approach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,\n",
      "as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a\n",
      "charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.—The\n",
      "considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,\n",
      "gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a\n",
      "mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well\n",
      "clothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed\n",
      "and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the\n",
      "river making a close and handsome curve around it.\n",
      "It was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\n",
      "English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without\n",
      "being oppressive.\n",
      "In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\n",
      "towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\n",
      "distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\n",
      "Harriet!—It was an odd tête-à-tête; but she was glad to see it.—There\n",
      "had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\n",
      "turned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\n",
      "conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been\n",
      "sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;\n",
      "but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its\n",
      "appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading\n",
      "flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.—She\n",
      "joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in\n",
      "looking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes of\n",
      "agriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, “These\n",
      "are my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without\n",
      "being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.”—She did not suspect him.\n",
      "It was too old a story.—Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of\n",
      "Harriet.—They took a few turns together along the walk.—The shade was\n",
      "most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\n",
      "The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they\n",
      "were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\n",
      "uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\n",
      "that he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\n",
      "coming, with more than common certainty. “His aunt was so much better,\n",
      "that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”—Mrs. Churchill’s\n",
      "state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\n",
      "sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\n",
      "dependence—and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\n",
      "that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented\n",
      "coming.—Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\n",
      "she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\n",
      "The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\n",
      "what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as\n",
      "far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\n",
      "any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.—Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\n",
      "of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by\n",
      "him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him,\n",
      "that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise\n",
      "and variety which her spirits seemed to need.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse’s\n",
      "entertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\n",
      "shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\n",
      "prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the\n",
      "kindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly\n",
      "well amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he\n",
      "would shew them all to Emma;—fortunate in having no other resemblance\n",
      "to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was\n",
      "slow, constant, and methodical.—Before this second looking over was\n",
      "begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few\n",
      "moments’ free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the\n",
      "house—and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly\n",
      "in from the garden, and with a look of escape.—Little expecting to meet\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "was the very person she was in quest of.\n",
      "“Will you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say that I am\n",
      "gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is,\n",
      "nor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we shall be wanted, and\n",
      "I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any\n",
      "body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to\n",
      "the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not\n",
      "be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I\n",
      "am gone?”\n",
      "“Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury\n",
      "alone?”\n",
      "“Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\n",
      "minutes.”\n",
      "“But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\n",
      "father’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can be\n",
      "round in five minutes.”\n",
      "“Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for\n",
      "_me_ to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may so soon have to guard\n",
      "others!”\n",
      "She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, “That\n",
      "can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\n",
      "carriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already.”\n",
      "“I am,”—she answered—“I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\n",
      "fatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse, we all know at\n",
      "times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\n",
      "exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me\n",
      "have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.”\n",
      "Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\n",
      "her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched\n",
      "her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\n",
      "grateful—and her parting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\n",
      "being sometimes alone!”—seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\n",
      "to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\n",
      "even towards some of those who loved her best.\n",
      "“Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said Emma, as she turned back into\n",
      "the hall again. “I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\n",
      "their just horrors, the more I shall like you.”\n",
      "Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\n",
      "accomplished some views of St. Mark’s Place, Venice, when Frank\n",
      "Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\n",
      "forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\n",
      "would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right who\n",
      "had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by a\n",
      "temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\n",
      "lasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\n",
      "till very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how\n",
      "late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\n",
      "come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\n",
      "like it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him like\n",
      "heat—he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\n",
      "intolerable—and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\n",
      "slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse’s fire, looking very deplorable.\n",
      "“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said Emma.\n",
      "“As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\n",
      "spared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\n",
      "going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\n",
      "came—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!”\n",
      "Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill’s\n",
      "state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\n",
      "humour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\n",
      "his constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\n",
      "the cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some\n",
      "refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\n",
      "dining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door.\n",
      "“No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\n",
      "hotter.” In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\n",
      "muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all\n",
      "her attention to her father, saying in secret—\n",
      "“I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\n",
      "who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet’s sweet easy\n",
      "temper will not mind it.”\n",
      "He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\n",
      "back all the better—grown quite cool—and, with good manners, like\n",
      "himself—able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\n",
      "employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\n",
      "He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\n",
      "at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\n",
      "over views in Swisserland.\n",
      "“As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,” said he. “I shall\n",
      "never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\n",
      "sketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to read—or my poem.\n",
      "I shall do something to expose myself.”\n",
      "“That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\n",
      "Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave\n",
      "England.”\n",
      "“They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\n",
      "her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\n",
      "assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\n",
      "shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\n",
      "want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\n",
      "eyes may fancy—I am sick of England—and would leave it to-morrow, if I\n",
      "could.”\n",
      "“You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\n",
      "hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?”\n",
      "“_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\n",
      "not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in\n",
      "every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\n",
      "person.”\n",
      "“You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\n",
      "eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice\n",
      "of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you\n",
      "nearly on a par with the rest of us.”\n",
      "“No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.”\n",
      "“We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not\n",
      "Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want\n",
      "of a change. You will stay, and go with us?”\n",
      "“No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.”\n",
      "“But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.”\n",
      "“No—It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.”\n",
      "“Then pray stay at Richmond.”\n",
      "“But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of\n",
      "you all there without me.”\n",
      "“These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\n",
      "own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.”\n",
      "The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\n",
      "With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\n",
      "took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\n",
      "disturbance on Miss Fairfax’s disappearance being explained. That it\n",
      "was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short\n",
      "final arrangement for the next day’s scheme, they parted. Frank\n",
      "Churchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much,\n",
      "that his last words to Emma were,\n",
      "“Well;—if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.”\n",
      "She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from\n",
      "Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.\n",
      "CHAPTER VII\n",
      "They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\n",
      "circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\n",
      "favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\n",
      "safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\n",
      "time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\n",
      "the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\n",
      "Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\n",
      "had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\n",
      "of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of\n",
      "spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated\n",
      "too much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took\n",
      "charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank\n",
      "Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise\n",
      "better. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never\n",
      "materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness\n",
      "to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole\n",
      "hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\n",
      "separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine\n",
      "prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to\n",
      "remove.\n",
      "At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\n",
      "Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing—looked\n",
      "without seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing\n",
      "what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\n",
      "should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\n",
      "When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\n",
      "for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first\n",
      "object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to\n",
      "her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\n",
      "cared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\n",
      "was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the\n",
      "admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most\n",
      "animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own\n",
      "estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people\n",
      "looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but\n",
      "flirtation could very well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves\n",
      "open to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple\n",
      "Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and\n",
      "thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less\n",
      "happy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;\n",
      "and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,\n",
      "whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious,\n",
      "they were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "“How much I am obliged to you,” said he, “for telling me to come\n",
      "to-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\n",
      "the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.”\n",
      "“Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that\n",
      "you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than\n",
      "you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to\n",
      "come.”\n",
      "“Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.”\n",
      "“It is hotter to-day.”\n",
      "“Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.”\n",
      "“You are comfortable because you are under command.”\n",
      "“Your command?—Yes.”\n",
      "“Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\n",
      "somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\n",
      "management; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot be always\n",
      "with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\n",
      "rather than mine.”\n",
      "“It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\n",
      "motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\n",
      "with me. You are always with me.”\n",
      "“Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\n",
      "begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour\n",
      "before.”\n",
      "“Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\n",
      "first in February.”\n",
      "“Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)—nobody\n",
      "speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\n",
      "nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”\n",
      "“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” replied he, with lively\n",
      "impudence. “I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\n",
      "hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and\n",
      "Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.” And then\n",
      "whispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to\n",
      "rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies and\n",
      "gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\n",
      "presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\n",
      "of?”\n",
      "Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\n",
      "deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse’s presiding; Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s answer was the most distinct.\n",
      "“Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\n",
      "thinking of?”\n",
      "“Oh! no, no”—cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could—“Upon no\n",
      "account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\n",
      "of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all\n",
      "thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,\n",
      "(glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be\n",
      "afraid of knowing.”\n",
      "“It is a sort of thing,” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, “which _I_\n",
      "should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\n",
      "perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party—_I_ never was in any\n",
      "circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—”\n",
      "Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\n",
      "“Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but\n",
      "some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body\n",
      "knows what is due to _you_.”\n",
      "“It will not do,” whispered Frank to Emma; “they are most of them\n",
      "affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen—I\n",
      "am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\n",
      "knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\n",
      "something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\n",
      "are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\n",
      "entertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\n",
      "thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated—or two\n",
      "things moderately clever—or three things very dull indeed, and she\n",
      "engages to laugh heartily at them all.”\n",
      "“Oh! very well,” exclaimed Miss Bates, “then I need not be uneasy.\n",
      "‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me, you know. I\n",
      "shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\n",
      "shan’t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on\n",
      "every body’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall?”\n",
      "Emma could not resist.\n",
      "“Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you will be\n",
      "limited as to number—only three at once.”\n",
      "Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\n",
      "immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\n",
      "anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\n",
      "“Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\n",
      "Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\n",
      "disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old\n",
      "friend.”\n",
      "“I like your plan,” cried Mr. Weston. “Agreed, agreed. I will do my\n",
      "best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?”\n",
      "“Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his son;—“but we shall be\n",
      "indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.”\n",
      "“No, no,” said Emma, “it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\n",
      "Weston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\n",
      "hear it.”\n",
      "“I doubt its being very clever myself,” said Mr. Weston. “It is too\n",
      "much a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet\n",
      "are there, that express perfection?”\n",
      "“What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not know.”\n",
      "“Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\n",
      "guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you understand?”\n",
      "Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\n",
      "indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\n",
      "enjoy in it—and so did Frank and Harriet.—It did not seem to touch the\n",
      "rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\n",
      "Knightley gravely said,\n",
      "“This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\n",
      "has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\n",
      "else. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.”\n",
      "“Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,” said Mrs. Elton; “_I_\n",
      "really cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\n",
      "an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\n",
      "pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—You know\n",
      "who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well\n",
      "at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\n",
      "place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in\n",
      "summer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have\n",
      "witty things at every body’s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I\n",

      "“With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\n",
      "Come, Jane, take my other arm.”\n",
      "Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. “Happy\n",

      "any real knowledge of a person’s disposition that Bath, or any public\n",
      "place, can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\n",
      "only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\n",
      "they always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\n",
      "is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\n",
      "has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\n",
      "of his life!”\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\n",

      "“Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—She was stopped by a cough. Frank\n",

      "“I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate\n",
      "circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot\n",
      "imagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may\n",
      "arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I\n",
      "would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute\n",
      "characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)\n",
      "who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an\n",
      "oppression for ever.”\n",
      "He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\n",
      "afterwards said, in a lively tone,\n",
      "“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\n",
      "marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning\n",
      "to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I should like any\n",
      "body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a\n",
      "smile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt\n",

      "“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\n",
      "I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come\n",
      "to you for my wife. Remember.”\n",
      "Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\n",
      "favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\n",
      "Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\n",
      "He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could\n",
      "say? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\n",
      "“Now, ma’am,” said Jane to her aunt, “shall we join Mrs. Elton?”\n",
      "“If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\n",
      "ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\n",

      "They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.\n",
      "Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man’s\n",
      "spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at\n",
      "last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking\n",
      "quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and\n",
      "quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views\n",
      "beneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them to\n",
      "give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of\n",
      "collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to\n",
      "have _her_ carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the\n",
      "quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of\n",
      "this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many\n",
      "ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.\n",
      "While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\n",
      "looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\n",
      "“Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\n",
      "privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use\n",
      "it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could\n",
      "you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your\n",
      "wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?—Emma, I had not\n",
      "thought it possible.”\n",
      "Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\n",
      "“Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have helped it.\n",
      "It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”\n",
      "“I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it\n",
      "since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what\n",
      "candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\n",
      "forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\n",
      "ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\n",
      "so irksome.”\n",
      "“Oh!” cried Emma, “I know there is not a better creature in the world:\n",
      "but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\n",
      "unfortunately blended in her.”\n",
      "“They are blended,” said he, “I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\n",
      "I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\n",
      "the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\n",
      "absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\n",
      "liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation—but, Emma,\n",
      "consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\n",
      "from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\n",
      "probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\n",
      "badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she\n",
      "had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have\n",
      "you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at\n",
      "her, humble her—and before her niece, too—and before others, many of\n",
      "whom (certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\n",
      "of her.—This is not pleasant to you, Emma—and it is very far from\n",
      "pleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I will tell you truths while I can;\n",
      "satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\n",
      "trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than\n",
      "you can do now.”\n",
      "While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\n",
      "ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\n",
      "misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\n",
      "tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\n",
      "mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,\n",
      "on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome—then\n",
      "reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no\n",
      "acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with\n",
      "voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He\n",
      "had turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look\n",
      "back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they\n",
      "were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was\n",
      "vexed beyond what could have been expressed—almost beyond what she\n",
      "could conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at\n",
      "any circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth\n",
      "of this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.\n",
      "How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could\n",
      "she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And\n",
      "how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of\n",
      "concurrence, of common kindness!\n",
      "Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\n",
      "it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\n",
      "to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\n",
      "fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\n",
      "down her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble\n",
      "to check them, extraordinary as they were.\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n",
      "The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma’s thoughts all the\n",
      "evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\n",
      "not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\n",
      "might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a\n",
      "morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\n",
      "satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\n",
      "any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her\n",
      "father, was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for\n",
      "there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his\n",
      "comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond\n",
      "affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct,\n",
      "be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not\n",
      "without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, “How could\n",
      "you be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I will tell you truths\n",
      "while I can.” Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If attention, in\n",
      "future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had\n",
      "been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in\n",
      "thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.\n",
      "In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next\n",
      "morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular,\n",
      "equal, kindly intercourse.\n",
      "She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\n",
      "nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\n",
      "might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while\n",
      "she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\n",
      "ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\n",
      "Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\n",
      "“The ladies were all at home.” She had never rejoiced at the sound\n",
      "before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\n",
      "with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\n",
      "deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\n",
      "There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\n",
      "She heard Miss Bates’s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\n",
      "maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait\n",
      "a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed\n",
      "both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse\n",
      "of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she\n",
      "heard Miss Bates saying, “Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid\n",
      "down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.”\n",
      "Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did\n",
      "not quite understand what was going on.\n",
      "“I am afraid Jane is not very well,” said she, “but I do not know; they\n",
      "_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I\n",
      "am very little able—Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you like?\n",
      "I am sure she will be here presently.”\n",
      "Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment’s fear of Miss Bates\n",
      "keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came—“Very happy and\n",
      "obliged”—but Emma’s conscience told her that there was not the same\n",
      "cheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner. A very\n",
      "friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\n",
      "return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\n",
      "“Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—and are\n",
      "come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\n",
      "me—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very trying for us to\n",
      "part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\n",
      "headache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters, you\n",
      "know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. ‘My dear,’\n",
      "said I, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were in her eyes\n",
      "perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great\n",
      "change; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, I\n",
      "suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do\n",
      "not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good\n",
      "fortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you were\n",
      "to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one\n",
      "cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as\n",
      "possible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy\n",
      "she is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming\n",
      "to you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie\n",
      "down upon the bed. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘I shall say you are laid down\n",
      "upon the bed:’ but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room.\n",
      "But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be\n",
      "well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door—I\n",
      "was quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so\n",
      "happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the\n",
      "stairs, we did not know any body was coming. ‘It is only Mrs. Cole,’\n",
      "said I, ‘depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.’ ‘Well,’ said\n",
      "she, ‘it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.’\n",
      "But then Patty came in, and said it was you. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘it is Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.’—‘I can see nobody,’\n",
      "said she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us\n",
      "keep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. ‘If you must\n",
      "go, my dear,’ said I, ‘you must, and I will say you are laid down upon\n",
      "the bed.’”\n",
      "Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\n",
      "kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\n",
      "as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\n",
      "but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\n",
      "sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\n",
      "naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when\n",
      "she might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest\n",
      "regret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that the circumstances which\n",
      "she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might\n",
      "be as much for Miss Fairfax’s advantage and comfort as possible. “It\n",
      "must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be\n",
      "delayed till Colonel Campbell’s return.”\n",
      "“So very kind!” replied Miss Bates. “But you are always kind.”\n",
      "There was no bearing such an “always;” and to break through her\n",
      "dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of—\n",
      "“Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?”\n",
      "“To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge\n",
      "of her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible that any\n",
      "situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\n",
      "Mrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge is\n",
      "intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four\n",
      "miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.”\n",
      "“Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes—”\n",
      "“Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\n",
      "would not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, ‘No;’ for when\n",
      "Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very\n",
      "morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite\n",
      "decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;\n",
      "exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till\n",
      "Colonel Campbell’s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into\n",
      "any engagement at present—and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\n",
      "again—and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\n",
      "mind!—but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\n",
      "farther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\n",
      "such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane’s answer; but she\n",
      "positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\n",
      "Jane wished her; she would wait—and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\n",
      "was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\n",
      "the least idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\n",
      "upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge’s situation, she\n",
      "had come to the resolution of accepting it.—I did not know a word of it\n",
      "till it was all settled.”\n",
      "“You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?”\n",
      "“Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\n",
      "the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. ‘You _must_\n",
      "_all_ spend your evening with us,’ said she—‘I positively must have you\n",
      "_all_ come.’”\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?”\n",
      "“No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\n",
      "thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\n",
      "him off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\n",
      "and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\n",
      "rather fagged after the morning’s party. Even pleasure, you know, is\n",
      "fatiguing—and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\n",
      "enjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\n",
      "and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.”\n",

      "“I dare say she had.”\n",
      "“Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\n",

      "possible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.”\n",
      "“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in\n",
      "the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\n",
      "Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\n",
      "and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton’s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\n",
      "delightful woman!—A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as\n",
      "to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\n",
      "are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\n",
      "such regard and kindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\n",

      "Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me\n",
      "upon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could not be before tea, because\n",
      "we were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea, because I\n",
      "remember thinking—Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something\n",
      "happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room\n",
      "before tea, old John Abdy’s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old\n",
      "John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father\n",
      "twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very\n",
      "poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must go and see him\n",
      "to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor\n",
      "John’s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he\n",
      "is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,\n",
      "ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his\n",
      "father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us\n",
      "what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the\n",
      "chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to\n",
      "Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane\n",
      "spoke to Mrs. Elton.”\n",
      "Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\n",
      "circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\n",
      "could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill’s\n",
      "going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\n",
      "What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\n",
      "accumulation of the ostler’s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\n",
      "servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\n",
      "soon after the return of the party from Box Hill—which messenger,\n",
      "however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\n",
      "sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\n",
      "account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\n",
      "back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\n",
      "resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\n",
      "seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\n",
      "Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\n",
      "going a good pace, and driving very steady.\n",
      "There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\n",
      "caught Emma’s attention only as it united with the subject which\n",
      "already engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill’s\n",
      "importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax’s, struck her; one was every\n",
      "thing, the other nothing—and she sat musing on the difference of\n",
      "woman’s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\n",
      "till roused by Miss Bates’s saying,\n",
      "“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\n",
      "of that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.—‘You\n",
      "must go,’ said she. ‘You and I must part. You will have no business\n",
      "here.—Let it stay, however,’ said she; ‘give it houseroom till Colonel\n",
      "Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\n",
      "me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.’—And to this day, I do\n",
      "believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter’s.”\n",
      "Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\n",
      "all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\n",
      "that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long\n",
      "enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to\n",
      "say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "Emma’s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\n",
      "but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\n",
      "Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\n",
      "with her father.—Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\n",
      "decidedly graver than usual, said,\n",
      "“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\n",
      "and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\n",
      "a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\n",
      "besides the ‘love,’ which nobody carries?”\n",
      "“Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?”\n",
      "“Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time.”\n",
      "Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\n",
      "however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\n",
      "again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going—her father\n",
      "began his inquiries.\n",
      "“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find my\n",
      "worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been very\n",
      "much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and\n",
      "Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\n",
      "attentive to them!”\n",
      "Emma’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\n",
      "and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\n",
      "Knightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\n",
      "her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\n",
      "had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.—\n",
      "He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified—and in\n",
      "another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\n",
      "friendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself\n",
      "made the first motion, she could not say—she might, perhaps, have\n",
      "rather offered it—but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was\n",
      "on the point of carrying it to his lips—when, from some fancy or other,\n",
      "he suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should\n",
      "change his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.—He\n",
      "would have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.—The\n",
      "intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his\n",
      "manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\n",
      "happened, but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him, of\n",
      "so simple, yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the\n",
      "attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.—He left\n",
      "them immediately afterwards—gone in a moment. He always moved with the\n",
      "alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\n",
      "now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\n",
      "Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\n",
      "had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure\n",
      "to talk over Jane Fairfax’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would\n",
      "she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew\n",
      "how much his visit would be enjoyed—but it might have happened at a\n",
      "better time—and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\n",
      "pleasanter.—They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be\n",
      "deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\n",
      "gallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\n",
      "his good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\n",
      "found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\n",
      "In the hope of diverting her father’s thoughts from the\n",
      "disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley’s going to London; and going so\n",
      "suddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\n",
      "Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the\n",
      "effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,—interested,\n",
      "without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax’s\n",
      "going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s going to London had been an unexpected blow.\n",
      "“I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\n",
      "settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\n",
      "her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\n",
      "situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\n",
      "be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor’s always was with me.\n",
      "You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\n",
      "was to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\n",
      "induced to go away after it has been her home so long.”\n",
      "The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\n",
      "into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\n",
      "death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\n",
      "to hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\n",
      "hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\n",
      "thing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\n",
      "struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\n",
      "It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\n",
      "gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\n",
      "surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\n",
      "she would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\n",
      "to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\n",
      "disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\n",
      "now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\n",
      "justified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\n",
      "event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\n",
      "imaginary complaints.\n",
      "“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\n",
      "more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the\n",
      "temper. It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what\n",
      "would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill’s loss would be\n",
      "dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”—Even Mr.\n",
      "Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman,\n",
      "who would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be\n",
      "as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over\n",
      "her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.\n",
      "How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It\n",
      "was also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill, the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both\n",
      "with awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how\n",
      "Frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw\n",
      "in a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith\n",
      "would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his\n",
      "wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into\n",
      "any thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the\n",
      "nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the\n",
      "cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.\n",
      "Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great\n",
      "self-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed\n",
      "nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of\n",
      "strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might\n",
      "endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill’s\n",
      "death with mutual forbearance.\n",
      "Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\n",
      "that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\n",
      "was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\n",
      "departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a\n",
      "very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\n",
      "visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\n",
      "Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\n",
      "on Emma’s side.\n",
      "It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\n",
      "prospects were closing, while Harriet’s opened, and whose engagements\n",
      "now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\n",
      "kindness—and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\n",
      "a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\n",
      "had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\n",
      "would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\n",
      "to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and\n",
      "testify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to\n",
      "spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation\n",
      "was refused, and by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough\n",
      "to write;” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it\n",
      "appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\n",
      "though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\n",
      "under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him\n",
      "doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge’s at the time\n",
      "proposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite\n",
      "quite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms,\n",
      "nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing\n",
      "apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought\n",
      "she had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so\n",
      "herself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\n",
      "present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\n",
      "disorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it\n",
      "otherwise—and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\n",
      "acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\n",
      "description. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\n",
      "in fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\n",
      "more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\n",
      "grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\n",
      "way of being useful. To take her—be it only an hour or two—from her\n",
      "aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\n",
      "conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\n",
      "following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\n",
      "she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\n",
      "hour that Jane would name—mentioning that she had Mr. Perry’s decided\n",
      "opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was\n",
      "only in this short note:\n",
      "“Miss Fairfax’s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\n",
      "exercise.”\n",
      "Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\n",
      "impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\n",
      "indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\n",
      "counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\n",
      "answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates’s,\n",
      "in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her—but it would not\n",
      "do;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\n",
      "with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\n",
      "service—and every thing that message could do was tried—but all in\n",
      "vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite\n",
      "unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\n",
      "worse.—Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\n",
      "but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\n",
      "that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\n",
      "“Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\n",
      "body—any body at all—Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied—and Mrs.\n",
      "Cole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said so much—but, except\n",
      "them, Jane would really see nobody.”\n",
      "Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\n",
      "and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\n",
      "she feel any right of preference herself—she submitted, therefore, and\n",
      "only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece’s appetite and diet,\n",
      "which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\n",
      "was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\n",
      "thing:—Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they\n",
      "could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\n",
      "distasteful.\n",
      "Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\n",
      "examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\n",
      "was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In\n",
      "half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from\n",
      "Miss Bates, but “dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being\n",
      "sent back; it was a thing she could not take—and, moreover, she\n",
      "insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.”\n",
      "When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\n",
      "about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\n",
      "the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\n",
      "exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\n",
      "she could have no doubt—putting every thing together—that Jane was\n",
      "resolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\n",
      "Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\n",
      "from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\n",
      "inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\n",
      "credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend:\n",
      "but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good,\n",
      "and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been\n",
      "privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have\n",
      "seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any\n",
      "thing to reprove.\n",
      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill’s decease, Emma was\n",
      "called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and\n",
      "wanted particularly to speak with her.”—He met her at the parlour-door,\n",
      "and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice,\n",
      "sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\n",
      "“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be\n",
      "possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”\n",
      "“Is she unwell?”\n",
      "“No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\n",
      "carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\n",
      "know—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?”\n",
      "“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\n",
      "you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not\n",
      "ill?”\n",
      "“Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\n",
      "time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”\n",
      "To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\n",
      "really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\n",
      "well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her\n",
      "father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon\n",
      "out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for\n",
      "Randalls.\n",
      "“Now,”—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now\n",
      "Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”\n",
      "“No, no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t ask me. I promised my wife to\n",
      "leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\n",
      "be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”\n",
      "“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.—“Good\n",
      "God!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened in Brunswick\n",
      "Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what\n",
      "it is.”\n",
      "“No, indeed you are mistaken.”—\n",
      "“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest\n",
      "friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—I charge you\n",
      "by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”\n",
      "“Upon my word, Emma.”—\n",
      "“Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour, that it\n",
      "has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What can be to be\n",
      "_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”\n",
      "“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is not in\n",
      "the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\n",
      "Knightley.”\n",
      "Emma’s courage returned, and she walked on.\n",
      "“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being _broke_ to you. I\n",
      "should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\n",
      "you—it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In short, my dear\n",
      "Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don’t say that\n",
      "it is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse.—If we\n",
      "walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”\n",
      "Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\n",
      "asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\n",
      "that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\n",
      "concern—something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\n",
      "circumstances of the family,—something which the late event at Richmond\n",
      "had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\n",
      "children, perhaps—and poor Frank cut off!—This, though very\n",
      "undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little\n",
      "more than an animating curiosity.\n",
      "“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they\n",
      "proceeded—speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\n",
      "than with any other view.\n",
      "“I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I assure\n",
      "you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time.”\n",
      "“Has your son been with you, then?”\n",
      "“Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.”\n",
      "For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\n",
      "and demure,\n",
      "“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”\n",
      "They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my dear,” said\n",
      "he, as they entered the room—“I have brought her, and now I hope you\n",
      "will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\n",
      "delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—And Emma distinctly\n",
      "heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,—“I have\n",
      "been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\n",
      "that Emma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\n",
      "eagerly said,\n",
      "“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\n",
      "find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I have been\n",
      "walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do\n",
      "not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\n",
      "distress, whatever it may be.”\n",
      "“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n",
      "“Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\n",
      "hear?”\n",
      "“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”\n",
      "“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”\n",
      "(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has\n",
      "been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\n",
      "impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\n",
      "subject,—to announce an attachment—”\n",
      "She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\n",
      "Harriet.\n",
      "“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an\n",
      "engagement—a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what will any\n",
      "body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\n",
      "engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”\n",
      "Emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\n",
      "“Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?”\n",
      "“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her\n",
      "eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to\n",
      "recover— “You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a\n",
      "solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth,\n",
      "and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\n",
      "themselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—It is so\n",
      "wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet\n",
      "almost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.—I thought I knew\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two\n",
      "ideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\n",
      "poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\n",
      "confirmation, repeated confirmation.\n",
      "“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is a\n",
      "circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\n",
      "all comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of\n",
      "them came to Highbury?”\n",
      "“Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma, very\n",
      "much. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\n",
      "cannot excuse.”\n",
      "Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend _not_ to\n",
      "understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\n",
      "that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\n",
      "apprehensive of.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma’s countenance was as\n",
      "steady as her words.\n",
      "“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\n",
      "present perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,\n",
      "that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\n",
      "did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay,\n",
      "was attached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\n",
      "Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\n",
      "for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\n",
      "believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\n",
      "utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\n",
      "than any thing else in the world could do.\n",
      "“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “On\n",
      "this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\n",
      "might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.—\n",
      "Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.”\n",
      "“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\n",
      "wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\n",
      "and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to\n",
      "come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so\n",
      "_very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he\n",
      "certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\n",
      "attention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How\n",
      "could he tell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that\n",
      "he might not be making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong\n",
      "indeed.”\n",
      "“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—”\n",
      "“And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to\n",
      "look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\n",
      "before her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity,\n",
      "which I can neither comprehend nor respect.”\n",
      "“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\n",
      "He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\n",
      "quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the\n",
      "full use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been\n",
      "misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed\n",
      "to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\n",
      "possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”\n",
      "“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much, much\n",
      "beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\n",
      "in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright\n",
      "integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain\n",
      "of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every\n",
      "transaction of his life.”\n",
      "“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\n",
      "in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\n",
      "many, very many, good qualities; and—”\n",
      "“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.—“Mrs. Smallridge, too!\n",
      "Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\n",
      "such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her\n",
      "even to think of such a measure!”\n",
      "“He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\n",
      "him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him—or at\n",
      "least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—Till yesterday, I\n",
      "know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I\n",
      "do not know how, but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery\n",
      "of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined\n",
      "him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\n",
      "his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\n",
      "concealment that had been carrying on so long.”\n",
      "Emma began to listen better.\n",
      "“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told me at\n",
      "parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\n",
      "seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\n",
      "us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\n",
      "may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be\n",
      "understood. Don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to\n",
      "condemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\n",
      "satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\n",
      "for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\n",
      "both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\n",
      "concealment.”\n",
      "“_His_ sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him\n",
      "much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”\n",
      "“Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a\n",
      "difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that\n",
      "family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have\n",
      "been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at\n",
      "rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly\n",
      "opposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when\n",
      "undue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with\n",
      "very little persuasion.”\n",
      "“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for Harriet.”\n",
      "“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\n",
      "morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy, some time—and\n",
      "then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\n",
      "to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\n",
      "he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much\n",
      "agitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a\n",
      "different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In\n",
      "addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\n",
      "very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of—and there was\n",
      "every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”\n",
      "“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with\n",
      "such perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know\n",
      "of the engagement?”\n",
      "Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\n",
      "“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being\n",
      "in the world but their two selves.”\n",
      "“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\n",
      "idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very\n",
      "abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\n",
      "hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—To come among us with\n",
      "professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to\n",
      "judge us all!—Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\n",
      "completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\n",
      "and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\n",
      "carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\n",
      "words that were never meant for both to hear.—They must take the\n",
      "consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\n",
      "perfectly agreeable!”\n",
      "“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am very sure\n",
      "that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might\n",
      "not have heard.”\n",
      "“You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\n",
      "imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”\n",
      "“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\n",
      "as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”\n",
      "At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the\n",
      "window, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited\n",
      "him in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let\n",
      "me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at\n",
      "ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the\n",
      "best of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her\n",
      "favour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not\n",
      "feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance\n",
      "for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a\n",
      "girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always\n",
      "given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in\n",
      "spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And\n",
      "how much may be said in her situation for even that error!”\n",
      "“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be excused\n",
      "for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\n",
      "Fairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is not their’s,\n",
      "nor the world’s law.’”\n",
      "She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\n",
      "exclaiming,\n",
      "“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\n",
      "device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent\n",
      "of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\n",
      "your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\n",
      "condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate\n",
      "you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of\n",
      "the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your\n",
      "daughter.”\n",
      "A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\n",
      "right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\n",
      "was immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he\n",
      "shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the\n",
      "subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and\n",
      "persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companions\n",
      "suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;\n",
      "and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked\n",
      "it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was\n",
      "become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best\n",
      "thing that Frank could possibly have done.\n",
      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "“Harriet, poor Harriet!”—Those were the words; in them lay the\n",
      "tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\n",
      "the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved\n",
      "very ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much _his_\n",
      "behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\n",
      "scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet’s account, that gave the\n",
      "deepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe\n",
      "of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\n",
      "prophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend to\n",
      "Harriet Smith.”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but\n",
      "disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\n",
      "instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\n",
      "the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\n",
      "never have entered Harriet’s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\n",
      "her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\n",
      "given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of\n",
      "having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\n",
      "prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\n",
      "would have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\n",
      "to have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend’s\n",
      "happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have\n",
      "directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think\n",
      "of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his\n",
      "ever caring for her.—“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid\n",
      "I have had little to do.”\n",
      "She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\n",
      "with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane\n",
      "Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\n",
      "solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no\n",
      "longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\n",
      "having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.—Her\n",
      "days of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well, and\n",
      "happy, and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\n",
      "had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\n",
      "doubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane’s eyes she had been a rival;\n",
      "and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\n",
      "repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\n",
      "and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\n",
      "understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\n",
      "the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\n",
      "Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\n",
      "desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was\n",
      "little sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\n",
      "that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\n",
      "Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\n",
      "judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet’s mind, producing\n",
      "reserve and self-command, it would.—She must communicate the painful\n",
      "truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\n",
      "been among Mr. Weston’s parting words. “For the present, the whole\n",
      "affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\n",
      "it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and\n",
      "every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”—Emma had\n",
      "promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\n",
      "In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\n",
      "ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\n",
      "office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through\n",
      "by herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to\n",
      "her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat\n",
      "quick on hearing Harriet’s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had\n",
      "poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the\n",
      "event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—But of that,\n",
      "unfortunately, there could be no chance.\n",
      "“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room—“is\n",
      "not this the oddest news that ever was?”\n",
      "“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\n",
      "voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\n",
      "“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!—you\n",
      "need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\n",
      "himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\n",
      "and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but\n",
      "you, but he said you knew it.”\n",
      "“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”—said Emma, still perplexed.\n",
      "“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\n",
      "another this long while. How very odd!”\n",
      "It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that\n",
      "Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\n",
      "absolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\n",
      "disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\n",
      "her, quite unable to speak.\n",
      "“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?—You,\n",
      "perhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\n",
      "body’s heart; but nobody else—”\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\n",
      "Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to\n",
      "another woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if not\n",
      "openly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I never had\n",
      "the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill’s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\n",
      "sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”\n",
      "“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should you caution\n",
      "me?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”\n",
      "“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied\n",
      "Emma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and\n",
      "not very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you\n",
      "did care about him?”\n",
      "“Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?”\n",
      "turning away distressed.\n",
      "“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment’s pause—“What do you mean?—Good\n",
      "Heaven! what do you mean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then?—”\n",
      "She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\n",
      "waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\n",
      "Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\n",
      "her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\n",
      "in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma’s.\n",
      "“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could\n",
      "have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but\n",
      "considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should\n",
      "not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other\n",
      "person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look\n",
      "at him in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than\n",
      "to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And\n",
      "that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!—I am sure, but for\n",
      "believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my\n",
      "attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a\n",
      "presumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not\n",
      "told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\n",
      "matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);—I should not\n",
      "have dared to give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if\n",
      "_you_, who had been always acquainted with him—”\n",
      "“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely—“Let us understand\n",
      "each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\n",
      "speaking of—Mr. Knightley?”\n",
      "“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—and so I\n",
      "thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\n",
      "possible.”\n",
      "“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you\n",
      "then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could\n",
      "almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the\n",
      "service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from\n",
      "the gipsies, was spoken of.”\n",
      "“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”\n",
      "“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\n",
      "the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that\n",
      "considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\n",
      "natural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\n",
      "your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations\n",
      "had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of\n",
      "it is strong on my memory.”\n",
      "“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean; but I was\n",
      "thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\n",
      "gipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\n",
      "elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\n",
      "stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\n",
      "was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity;\n",
      "that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to\n",
      "every other being upon earth.”\n",
      "“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most unfortunate—most\n",
      "deplorable mistake!—What is to be done?”\n",
      "“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\n",
      "least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\n",
      "other had been the person; and now—it _is_ possible—”\n",
      "She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\n",
      "“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a\n",
      "great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\n",
      "think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\n",
      "I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may\n",
      "appear—. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\n",
      "things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place\n",
      "than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if\n",
      "such a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be\n",
      "so fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should\n",
      "really—if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put\n",
      "difficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.”\n",
      "Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look\n",
      "at her in consternation, and hastily said,\n",
      "“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your affection?”\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“I must say that I\n",
      "have.”\n",
      "Emma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\n",
      "in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\n",
      "for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once\n",
      "opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched—she admitted—she\n",
      "acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet\n",
      "should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why\n",
      "was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet’s having some hope of a\n",
      "return? It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr.\n",
      "Knightley must marry no one but herself!\n",
      "Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\n",
      "few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\n",
      "her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\n",
      "inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\n",
      "her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck\n",
      "her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in\n",
      "the world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of\n",
      "all these demerits—some concern for her own appearance, and a strong\n",
      "sense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of _compassion_ to\n",
      "the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley—but justice\n",
      "required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave\n",
      "Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even\n",
      "apparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the\n",
      "utmost extent of Harriet’s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet\n",
      "had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so\n",
      "voluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by the\n",
      "person, whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from\n",
      "reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet\n",
      "again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as\n",
      "to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of\n",
      "Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but\n",
      "of Mr. Knightley and themselves.\n",
      "Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\n",
      "to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\n",
      "and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to\n",
      "give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\n",
      "delight.—Emma’s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were\n",
      "better concealed than Harriet’s, but they were not less. Her voice was\n",
      "not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a\n",
      "development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion\n",
      "of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.—She listened with much\n",
      "inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet’s\n",
      "detail.—Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could\n",
      "not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the\n",
      "feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her\n",
      "spirit—especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own\n",
      "memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley’s most improved opinion of\n",
      "Harriet.\n",
      "Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\n",
      "those two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\n",
      "found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\n",
      "least from the time of Miss Woodhouse’s encouraging her to think of\n",
      "him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more\n",
      "than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different\n",
      "manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she\n",
      "had been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking\n",
      "together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\n",
      "delightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\n",
      "to have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\n",
      "almost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and\n",
      "praise from him—and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with\n",
      "what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being\n",
      "without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\n",
      "feelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had\n",
      "dwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet’s\n",
      "memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\n",
      "him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a\n",
      "compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because\n",
      "unsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour’s\n",
      "relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had\n",
      "passed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest\n",
      "occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet,\n",
      "were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first,\n",
      "was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at\n",
      "Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he\n",
      "had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to\n",
      "himself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way\n",
      "than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet\n",
      "could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking\n",
      "her, whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she (Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and\n",
      "began talking about farming:—The second, was his having sat talking\n",
      "with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the\n",
      "very last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when he first came\n",
      "in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes—and his having told\n",
      "her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it\n",
      "was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which\n",
      "was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The\n",
      "superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article\n",
      "marked, gave her severe pain.\n",
      "On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\n",
      "little reflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?—Is\n",
      "not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\n",
      "your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin—he might have Mr.\n",
      "Martin’s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\n",
      "spirit.\n",
      "“Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\n",
      "know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\n",
      "“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she, “but\n",
      "for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be\n",
      "the rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\n",
      "deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\n",
      "very wonderful.”\n",
      "The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\n",
      "feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma’s side, to enable\n",
      "her to say on reply,\n",
      "“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the\n",
      "last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea\n",
      "of his feeling for her more than he really does.”\n",
      "Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\n",
      "satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\n",
      "at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\n",
      "father’s footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\n",
      "much agitated to encounter him. “She could not compose herself— Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse would be alarmed—she had better go;”—with most ready\n",
      "encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\n",
      "another door—and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous\n",
      "burst of Emma’s feelings: “Oh God! that I had never seen her!”\n",
      "The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\n",
      "thoughts.—She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\n",
      "rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\n",
      "fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\n",
      "her.—How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\n",
      "been thus practising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the\n",
      "blindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about,\n",
      "she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every\n",
      "posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\n",
      "been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\n",
      "been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was\n",
      "wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\n",
      "wretchedness.\n",
      "To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\n",
      "endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father’s\n",
      "claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\n",
      "How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\n",
      "declared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?—\n",
      "When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\n",
      "Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—She looked back; she\n",
      "compared the two—compared them, as they had always stood in her\n",
      "estimation, from the time of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as\n",
      "they must at any time have been compared by her, had it—oh! had it, by\n",
      "any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.—She\n",
      "saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\n",
      "Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had\n",
      "not been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\n",
      "in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\n",
      "delusion, totally ignorant of her own heart—and, in short, that she had\n",
      "never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\n",
      "This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the\n",
      "knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she\n",
      "reached; and without being long in reaching it.—She was most\n",
      "sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\n",
      "to her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind\n",
      "was disgusting.\n",
      "With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of\n",
      "every body’s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange\n",
      "every body’s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken;\n",
      "and she had not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief. She had\n",
      "brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\n",
      "Knightley.—Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\n",
      "her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\n",
      "attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\n",
      "Harriet’s;—and even were this not the case, he would never have known\n",
      "Harriet at all but for her folly.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance every\n",
      "wonder of the kind.—The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\n",
      "became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\n",
      "surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\n",
      "thought.—Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—Such an elevation on her\n",
      "side! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\n",
      "must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the\n",
      "sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification\n",
      "and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to\n",
      "himself.—Could it be?—No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very\n",
      "far, from impossible.—Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate\n",
      "abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one,\n",
      "perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek\n",
      "him?—Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal,\n",
      "inconsistent, incongruous—or for chance and circumstance (as second\n",
      "causes) to direct the human fate?\n",
      "Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\n",
      "ought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not, with a folly\n",
      "which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\n",
      "unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\n",
      "in the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been\n",
      "safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\n",
      "How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts\n",
      "to Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of\n",
      "such a man till actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble,\n",
      "had fewer scruples than formerly.—Her inferiority, whether of mind or\n",
      "situation, seemed little felt.—She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\n",
      "Elton’s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\n",
      "Knightley’s.—Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\n",
      "pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?—Who but\n",
      "herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\n",
      "and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?—If\n",
      "Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\n",
      "CHAPTER XII\n",
      "Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\n",
      "how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "first in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\n",
      "it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\n",
      "dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\n",
      "been.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\n",
      "female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\n",
      "could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\n",
      "he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\n",
      "many years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\n",
      "or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\n",
      "insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he\n",
      "would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but\n",
      "still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of\n",
      "mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an\n",
      "endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\n",
      "other creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew\n",
      "she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?—When the suggestions\n",
      "of hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she\n",
      "could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself\n",
      "not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by\n",
      "Mr. Knightley. _She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any\n",
      "idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very\n",
      "recent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he been by her\n",
      "behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed\n",
      "himself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but\n",
      "far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright\n",
      "justice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to deserve\n",
      "the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself\n",
      "which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one,\n",
      "at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and\n",
      "be overrating his regard for _her_.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be\n",
      "the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his\n",
      "life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at\n",
      "all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but\n",
      "continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr.\n",
      "Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of\n",
      "their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\n",
      "would be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It\n",
      "would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what\n",
      "she felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She\n",
      "would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\n",
      "hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be\n",
      "able to ascertain what the chances for it were.—She should see them\n",
      "henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\n",
      "hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know\n",
      "how to admit that she could be blinded here.—He was expected back every\n",
      "day. The power of observation would be soon given—frightfully soon it\n",
      "appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\n",
      "resolved against seeing Harriet.—It would do neither of them good, it\n",
      "would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.—She was\n",
      "resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\n",
      "no authority for opposing Harriet’s confidence. To talk would be only\n",
      "to irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to\n",
      "beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it\n",
      "to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\n",
      "topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were\n",
      "allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of\n",
      "others—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act as\n",
      "if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted,\n",
      "and approved, and was grateful.\n",
      "This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma’s\n",
      "thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\n",
      "sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours—Mrs. Weston, who had\n",
      "been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\n",
      "way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\n",
      "relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\n",
      "Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates’s, and gone through his\n",
      "share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\n",
      "induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\n",
      "much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a\n",
      "quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates’s parlour, with all the\n",
      "encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.\n",
      "A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\n",
      "friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\n",
      "of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at\n",
      "all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,\n",
      "and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and\n",
      "Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known;\n",
      "as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\n",
      "without leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\n",
      "was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\n",
      "family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\n",
      "or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”\n",
      "he observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\n",
      "had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short—and very\n",
      "great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\n",
      "hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\n",
      "how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\n",
      "satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\n",
      "daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\n",
      "gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\n",
      "respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\n",
      "thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\n",
      "themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\n",
      "Fairfax’s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\n",
      "invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\n",
      "on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs.\n",
      "Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\n",
      "embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\n",
      "Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first\n",
      "reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always\n",
      "feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the\n",
      "cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good\n",
      "deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief\n",
      "to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so\n",
      "long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\n",
      "many months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was one\n",
      "of her expressions. ‘I will not say, that since I entered into the\n",
      "engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I\n",
      "have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering\n",
      "lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\n",
      "consented to a private engagement?”\n",
      "“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to\n",
      "blame herself. ‘The consequence,’ said she, ‘has been a state of\n",
      "perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the\n",
      "punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\n",
      "Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting\n",
      "contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\n",
      "thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\n",
      "conscience tells me ought not to be.’ ‘Do not imagine, madam,’ she\n",
      "continued, ‘that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on\n",
      "the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error\n",
      "has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that\n",
      "present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the\n",
      "story known to Colonel Campbell.’”\n",
      "“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then excessively, I\n",
      "suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led\n",
      "to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\n",
      "judgment.”\n",
      "“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”\n",
      "“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have\n",
      "contributed to make her unhappy.”\n",
      "“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably\n",
      "had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\n",
      "misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\n",
      "consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was\n",
      "that of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\n",
      "amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\n",
      "and irritable to a degree that must have been—that had been—hard for\n",
      "him to bear. ‘I did not make the allowances,’ said she, ‘which I ought\n",
      "to have done, for his temper and spirits—his delightful spirits, and\n",
      "that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\n",
      "circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\n",
      "me, as they were at first.’ She then began to speak of you, and of the\n",
      "great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\n",
      "which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an\n",
      "opportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for every wish\n",
      "and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had never\n",
      "received any proper acknowledgment from herself.”\n",
      "“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously, “which,\n",
      "in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\n",
      "must be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\n",
      "were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\n",
      "Fairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is\n",
      "all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\n",
      "particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\n",
      "very good—I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\n",
      "should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”\n",
      "Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\n",
      "well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved\n",
      "him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with\n",
      "a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection—but she had too\n",
      "much to urge for Emma’s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square\n",
      "or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston\n",
      "ended with, “We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you\n",
      "know, but I hope it will soon come,” she was obliged to pause before\n",
      "she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could\n",
      "at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\n",
      "“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston’s parting question.\n",
      "“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\n",
      "intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.”\n",
      "Mrs. Weston’s communications furnished Emma with more food for\n",
      "unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\n",
      "sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\n",
      "not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\n",
      "envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\n",
      "Had she followed Mr. Knightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention\n",
      "to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\n",
      "better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to\n",
      "find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\n",
      "probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\n",
      "now.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\n",
      "an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other—what\n",
      "was she?—Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\n",
      "that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s confidence on this\n",
      "important matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she\n",
      "ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\n",
      "abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\n",
      "had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\n",
      "unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\n",
      "subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the\n",
      "levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill’s. Of all the sources of evil\n",
      "surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\n",
      "that she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\n",
      "perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\n",
      "her having stabbed Jane Fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on\n",
      "Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\n",
      "more.\n",
      "The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\n",
      "The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,\n",
      "and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the\n",
      "wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such\n",
      "cruel sights the longer visible.\n",
      "The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\n",
      "comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter’s side, and\n",
      "by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\n",
      "her of their first forlorn tête-à-tête, on the evening of Mrs. Weston’s\n",
      "wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and\n",
      "dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\n",
      "Hartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\n",
      "be over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\n",
      "approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\n",
      "no pleasures had been lost.—But her present forebodings she feared\n",
      "would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\n",
      "was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that\n",
      "might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might\n",
      "take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\n",
      "comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\n",
      "spirits only of ruined happiness.\n",
      "The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\n",
      "herself; and Mrs. Weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. They\n",
      "should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\n",
      "also.—Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\n",
      "Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near\n",
      "Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these\n",
      "losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of\n",
      "cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be\n",
      "no longer coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at\n",
      "all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their’s!—How\n",
      "was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet’s\n",
      "sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet’s\n",
      "society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the\n",
      "first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the\n",
      "best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma’s\n",
      "wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that\n",
      "it had been all her own work?\n",
      "When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\n",
      "a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few\n",
      "seconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or\n",
      "composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\n",
      "conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\n",
      "be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\n",
      "would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\n",
      "leave her less to regret when it were gone.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIII\n",
      "The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the\n",
      "same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\n",
      "Hartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\n",
      "softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\n",
      "summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,\n",
      "Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the\n",
      "exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and\n",
      "brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for\n",
      "the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry’s coming\n",
      "in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she\n",
      "lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—There, with spirits\n",
      "freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,\n",
      "when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\n",
      "towards her.—It was the first intimation of his being returned from\n",
      "London. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as\n",
      "unquestionably sixteen miles distant.—There was time only for the\n",
      "quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a\n",
      "minute they were together. The “How d’ye do’s” were quiet and\n",
      "constrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; they\n",
      "were all well.—When had he left them?—Only that morning. He must have\n",
      "had a wet ride.—Yes.—He meant to walk with her, she found. “He had just\n",
      "looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred\n",
      "being out of doors.”—She thought he neither looked nor spoke\n",
      "cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her\n",
      "fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his\n",
      "brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.\n",
      "They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\n",
      "at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\n",
      "give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\n",
      "speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\n",
      "encouragement to begin.—She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\n",
      "way to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not\n",
      "bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\n",
      "considered—resolved—and, trying to smile, began—\n",
      "“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\n",
      "surprize you.”\n",
      "“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”\n",
      "“Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”\n",
      "After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\n",
      "he replied,\n",
      "“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\n",
      "already.”\n",
      "“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\n",
      "him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\n",
      "at Mrs. Goddard’s in his way.\n",
      "“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\n",
      "at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”\n",
      "Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\n",
      "composure,\n",
      "“_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\n",
      "had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\n",
      "me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and\n",
      "a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”\n",
      "For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of\n",
      "having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn\n",
      "within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,\n",
      "in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\n",
      "“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent\n",
      "sense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know you will not allow\n",
      "yourself—.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken\n",
      "and subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest\n",
      "friendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!”—And in a louder, steadier\n",
      "tone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They will soon be in\n",
      "Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.”\n",
      "Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\n",
      "of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\n",
      "“You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you right.— I am\n",
      "not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going\n",
      "on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of,\n",
      "and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\n",
      "well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\n",
      "to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.”\n",
      "“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”—but\n",
      "checking himself—“No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am pleased that\n",
      "you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret, indeed! and it\n",
      "will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\n",
      "of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not\n",
      "farther entangled!—I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\n",
      "myself as to the degree of what you felt—I could only be certain that\n",
      "there was a preference—and a preference which I never believed him to\n",
      "deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded\n",
      "with that sweet young woman?—Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\n",
      "creature.”\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused—“I\n",
      "am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\n",
      "error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\n",
      "have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\n",
      "at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be\n",
      "natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I\n",
      "never have.”\n",
      "He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\n",
      "not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\n",
      "clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself\n",
      "in his opinion. She went on, however.\n",
      "“I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his\n",
      "attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story,\n",
      "probably—a common case—and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\n",
      "sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\n",
      "as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\n",
      "He was the son of Mr. Weston—he was continually here—I always found him\n",
      "very pleasant—and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\n",
      "causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last—my vanity\n",
      "was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some\n",
      "time, indeed—I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought\n",
      "them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\n",
      "He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\n",
      "attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\n",
      "never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\n",
      "situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him; and\n",
      "no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself—except\n",
      "that I was _not_ blinded—that it was my good fortune—that, in short, I\n",
      "was somehow or other safe from him.”\n",
      "She had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her\n",
      "conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as\n",
      "she could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual\n",
      "tone, he said,\n",
      "“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose,\n",
      "however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\n",
      "been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\n",
      "may yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no\n",
      "motive for wishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be\n",
      "involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma; “I believe\n",
      "them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”\n",
      "“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. “So\n",
      "early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a man chuses a\n",
      "wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a\n",
      "prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has\n",
      "before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love,\n",
      "for Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every\n",
      "thing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as regards\n",
      "society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in\n",
      "every point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not\n",
      "to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his\n",
      "to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to\n",
      "give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who\n",
      "can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be\n",
      "the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of\n",
      "fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young\n",
      "woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\n",
      "by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the\n",
      "world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her\n",
      "superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to\n",
      "speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used\n",
      "every body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a\n",
      "fortunate man indeed!”\n",
      "“You speak as if you envied him.”\n",
      "“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.”\n",
      "Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of\n",
      "Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\n",
      "possible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\n",
      "different—the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\n",
      "breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\n",
      "“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined, I\n",
      "see, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma, I\n",
      "must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\n",
      "next moment.”\n",
      "“Oh! then, don’t speak it, don’t speak it,” she eagerly cried. “Take a\n",
      "little time, consider, do not commit yourself.”\n",
      "“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\n",
      "another syllable followed.\n",
      "Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\n",
      "her—perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would, she would listen.\n",
      "She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\n",
      "just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own\n",
      "independence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be\n",
      "more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.—They had\n",
      "reached the house.\n",
      "“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.\n",
      "“No,”—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he\n",
      "still spoke—“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\n",
      "gone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added—“I stopped you\n",
      "ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\n",
      "pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to\n",
      "ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a\n",
      "friend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like. I\n",
      "will tell you exactly what I think.”\n",
      "“As a friend!”—repeated Mr. Knightley.—“Emma, that I fear is a word—No,\n",
      "I have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far\n",
      "already for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it\n",
      "may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me,\n",
      "then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”\n",
      "He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\n",
      "of his eyes overpowered her.\n",
      "“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever\n",
      "the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved\n",
      "Emma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be said.”—She could really\n",
      "say nothing.—“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;\n",
      "“absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”\n",
      "Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\n",
      "dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\n",
      "prominent feeling.\n",
      "“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of such\n",
      "sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\n",
      "convincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\n",
      "more. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I\n",
      "have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\n",
      "woman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell\n",
      "you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner,\n",
      "perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a\n",
      "very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you\n",
      "understand my feelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I\n",
      "ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”\n",
      "While he spoke, Emma’s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\n",
      "velocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing a word—to\n",
      "catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\n",
      "Harriet’s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as\n",
      "complete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that\n",
      "she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to\n",
      "Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and\n",
      "that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had\n",
      "been all received as discouragement from herself.—And not only was\n",
      "there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant\n",
      "happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet’s secret had not\n",
      "escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.—It was\n",
      "all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of\n",
      "that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him\n",
      "to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the\n",
      "most worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving\n",
      "to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive,\n",
      "because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for\n",
      "Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run\n",
      "mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her\n",
      "brain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her\n",
      "for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong\n",
      "as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him,\n",
      "as most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite\n",
      "smooth.—She spoke then, on being so entreated.—What did she say?—Just\n",
      "what she ought, of course. A lady always does.—She said enough to shew\n",
      "there need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself. He\n",
      "_had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to\n",
      "caution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;—she had begun\n",
      "by refusing to hear him.—The change had perhaps been somewhat\n",
      "sudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the\n",
      "conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little\n",
      "extraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so\n",
      "obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.\n",
      "Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human\n",
      "disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little\n",
      "disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the\n",
      "conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very\n",
      "material.—Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart\n",
      "than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\n",
      "He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\n",
      "followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\n",
      "in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill’s engagement, with\n",
      "no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed\n",
      "him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.—The rest had been the work\n",
      "of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings.\n",
      "The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank\n",
      "Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had\n",
      "given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection\n",
      "himself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only, in the momentary\n",
      "conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did\n",
      "not forbid his attempt to attach her.—The superior hopes which\n",
      "gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.—The affection, which\n",
      "he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already\n",
      "his!—Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed\n",
      "state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could\n",
      "bear no other name.\n",
      "_Her_ change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the same\n",
      "precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\n",
      "degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there had been\n",
      "a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\n",
      "of Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\n",
      "Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\n",
      "enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\n",
      "that had taken him from the country.—The Box Hill party had decided him\n",
      "on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such\n",
      "permitted, encouraged attentions.—He had gone to learn to be\n",
      "indifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\n",
      "domestic happiness in his brother’s house; woman wore too amiable a\n",
      "form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only in those\n",
      "striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy\n",
      "before him, for much to have been done, even had his time been\n",
      "longer.—He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day—till this\n",
      "very morning’s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then,\n",
      "with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to\n",
      "feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving\n",
      "Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\n",
      "that he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and\n",
      "had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best\n",
      "of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the\n",
      "discovery.\n",
      "He had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.— He\n",
      "heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill’s\n",
      "character was not desperate.—She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\n",
      "when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of\n",
      "Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of\n",
      "fellow.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\n",
      "what she had brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a\n",
      "little respite of suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of\n",
      "happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\n",
      "greater when the flutter should have passed away.\n",
      "They sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often it\n",
      "had been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\n",
      "shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\n",
      "western sun!—But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\n",
      "like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\n",
      "usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in\n",
      "the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\n",
      "anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.—Could he have\n",
      "seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but\n",
      "without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the\n",
      "slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of\n",
      "either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news\n",
      "he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much\n",
      "self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him\n",
      "in return.\n",
      "As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma’s fever continued;\n",
      "but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\n",
      "subdued—and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for\n",
      "such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to\n",
      "consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\n",
      "alloy. Her father—and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\n",
      "the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\n",
      "of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it\n",
      "was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\n",
      "would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\n",
      "solemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the\n",
      "idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\n",
      "engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger\n",
      "of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.—How\n",
      "to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare\n",
      "her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\n",
      "how to appear least her enemy?—On these subjects, her perplexity and\n",
      "distress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again\n",
      "through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\n",
      "surrounded it.—She could only resolve at last, that she would still\n",
      "avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\n",
      "letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\n",
      "just now for a time from Highbury, and—indulging in one scheme\n",
      "more—nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\n",
      "for her to Brunswick Square.—Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\n",
      "and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.—She did\n",
      "not think it in Harriet’s nature to escape being benefited by novelty\n",
      "and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.—At any rate,\n",
      "it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\n",
      "every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\n",
      "evil day, when they must all be together again.\n",
      "She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\n",
      "left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\n",
      "up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\n",
      "an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\n",
      "literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\n",
      "proper share of the happiness of the evening before.\n",
      "He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\n",
      "slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\n",
      "brought her from Randalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must\n",
      "contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.—She was now in\n",
      "perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\n",
      "wanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding\n",
      "any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.—It must be\n",
      "waded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a\n",
      "note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\n",
      "Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "“I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\n",
      "enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have\n",
      "scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially\n",
      "disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long\n",
      "preface.—We are quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the\n",
      "little nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like\n",
      "your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you\n",
      "will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a\n",
      "north-east wind.—I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of\n",
      "Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing\n",
      "last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\n",
      "“Yours ever,\n",
      "“A. W.”\n",
      "[_To Mrs. Weston_.]\n",
      "Windsor—July.\n",
      "MY DEAR MADAM,\n",
      "“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;\n",
      "but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\n",
      "indulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\n",
      "even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But\n",
      "I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\n",
      "rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\n",
      "humble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\n",
      "pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\n",
      "and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You\n",
      "must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when\n",
      "I first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret\n",
      "which was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to\n",
      "place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another\n",
      "question. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it\n",
      "a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,\n",
      "and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\n",
      "difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\n",
      "require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\n",
      "parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\n",
      "creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused, I\n",
      "should have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say, what was your hope\n",
      "in doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing, every\n",
      "thing—to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\n",
      "perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\n",
      "good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining\n",
      "her promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther\n",
      "explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband’s\n",
      "son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good,\n",
      "which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value\n",
      "of.—See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit\n",
      "to Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might\n",
      "have been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come\n",
      "till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person\n",
      "slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father’s\n",
      "compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from\n",
      "his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour,\n",
      "during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I\n",
      "hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I\n",
      "come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while\n",
      "belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very\n",
      "solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest\n",
      "friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I\n",
      "ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped\n",
      "from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge\n",
      "myself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,\n",
      "more than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to\n",
      "me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of\n",
      "intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the\n",
      "declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would\n",
      "not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and\n",
      "delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young\n",
      "woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any\n",
      "tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my\n",
      "wish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured\n",
      "playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each\n",
      "other. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and\n",
      "were felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand\n",
      "me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called\n",
      "to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of\n",
      "confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;\n",
      "but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some\n",
      "degree.—She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\n",
      "have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the\n",
      "subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take\n",
      "her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember\n",
      "her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her\n",
      "attentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards\n",
      "her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what\n",
      "you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\n",
      "Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\n",
      "procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of\n",
      "that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\n",
      "affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\n",
      "myself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\n",
      "you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\n",
      "get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\n",
      "If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.—Of\n",
      "the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\n",
      "its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would never\n",
      "have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.—The delicacy\n",
      "of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much\n",
      "beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope,\n",
      "know her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her. She must\n",
      "tell you herself what she is—yet not by word, for never was there a\n",
      "human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I\n",
      "began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard\n",
      "from her.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never\n",
      "complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks.\n",
      "I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\n",
      "Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am\n",
      "impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at\n",
      "Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much\n",
      "better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I think\n",
      "of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and\n",
      "patience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I\n",
      "recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve\n",
      "to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!—But\n",
      "I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to\n",
      "encroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\n",
      "that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\n",
      "yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\n",
      "with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the\n",
      "event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me\n",
      "the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early\n",
      "measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not\n",
      "an hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,\n",
      "and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength\n",
      "and refinement.—But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had\n",
      "entered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to\n",
      "leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been\n",
      "walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make\n",
      "the rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most\n",
      "mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can\n",
      "admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were\n",
      "highly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been\n",
      "enough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think\n",
      "sufficient.—She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought\n",
      "her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I\n",
      "thought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her\n",
      "judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed\n",
      "proper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever\n",
      "known.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at\n",
      "Donwell?—_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before\n",
      "came to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and\n",
      "wanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely\n",
      "refused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now,\n",
      "however, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree\n",
      "of discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was\n",
      "behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,\n",
      "was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\n",
      "every previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together\n",
      "between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.—I was\n",
      "mad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her affection. I doubted it\n",
      "more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my\n",
      "side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent\n",
      "devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of\n",
      "sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly\n",
      "intelligible to me.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless\n",
      "on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to\n",
      "Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning,\n",
      "merely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I\n",
      "was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was\n",
      "the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined\n",
      "that she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate\n",
      "myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\n",
      "behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well\n",
      "of me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it\n",
      "produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she\n",
      "closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of\n",
      "whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation\n",
      "and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has\n",
      "been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\n",
      "protest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane,’\n",
      "indeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling\n",
      "her by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in\n",
      "hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of\n",
      "needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.\n",
      "Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with this\n",
      "offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to\n",
      "tell me that we never were to meet again.—_She_ _felt_ _the_\n",
      "_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\n",
      "_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.—This letter reached me on the very\n",
      "morning of my poor aunt’s death. I answered it within an hour; but from\n",
      "the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on\n",
      "me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other\n",
      "letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting\n",
      "that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,\n",
      "remained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did\n",
      "not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was\n",
      "too busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We\n",
      "removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from\n",
      "her, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by\n",
      "the post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest\n",
      "reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\n",
      "not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to\n",
      "have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she\n",
      "now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that\n",
      "if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury\n",
      "within a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in\n",
      "short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near Bristol, stared me\n",
      "in the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and\n",
      "instantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with\n",
      "that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the\n",
      "secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,\n",
      "was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would\n",
      "not she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how,\n",
      "till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of\n",
      "the post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my\n",
      "uncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I\n",
      "spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\n",
      "away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\n",
      "wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with\n",
      "a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the\n",
      "marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different\n",
      "sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in\n",
      "opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?—No;\n",
      "do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.\n",
      "Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.—I reached Highbury at\n",
      "the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I\n",
      "was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not\n",
      "disappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object\n",
      "of my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I\n",
      "had to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much\n",
      "dearer, than ever, and no moment’s uneasiness can ever occur between us\n",
      "again. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude\n",
      "before. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\n",
      "ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will\n",
      "dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I\n",
      "deserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good\n",
      "fortune. I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good fortune is\n",
      "undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,\n",
      "Your obliged and affectionate Son,\n",
      "F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\n",
      "CHAPTER XV\n",
      "This letter must make its way to Emma’s feelings. She was obliged, in\n",
      "spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\n",
      "justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\n",
      "it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\n",
      "and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the\n",
      "subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her\n",
      "former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any\n",
      "picture of love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till\n",
      "she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to\n",
      "feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had\n",
      "supposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful\n",
      "to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so\n",
      "happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have\n",
      "entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as\n",
      "ever.\n",
      "She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\n",
      "she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston’s wishing it to\n",
      "be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen\n",
      "so much to blame in his conduct.\n",
      "“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it seems long. I\n",
      "will take it home with me at night.”\n",
      "But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\n",
      "must return it by him.\n",
      "“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a\n",
      "matter of justice, it shall be done.”\n",
      "He began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered\n",
      "the sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law a few\n",
      "months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”\n",
      "He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\n",
      "smile, observed, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\n",
      "way. One man’s style must not be the rule of another’s. We will not be\n",
      "severe.”\n",
      "“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to speak my\n",
      "opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\n",
      "It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—”\n",
      "“Not at all. I should wish it.”\n",
      "Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\n",
      "“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows he is\n",
      "wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to have\n",
      "formed the engagement.—‘His father’s disposition:’—he is unjust,\n",
      "however, to his father. Mr. Weston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on\n",
      "all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every\n",
      "present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he did not\n",
      "come till Miss Fairfax was here.”\n",
      "“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were that he might\n",
      "have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely—but you\n",
      "were perfectly right.”\n",
      "“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had\n",
      "_you_ not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him.”\n",
      "When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\n",
      "aloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\n",
      "head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\n",
      "the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\n",
      "reflection, thus—\n",
      "“Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous\n",
      "game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—No judge of his\n",
      "own manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\n",
      "regardless of little besides his own convenience.—Fancying you to have\n",
      "fathomed his secret. Natural enough!—his own mind full of intrigue,\n",
      "that he should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert\n",
      "the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\n",
      "and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with\n",
      "each other?”\n",
      "Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet’s\n",
      "account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\n",
      "“You had better go on,” said she.\n",
      "He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That\n",
      "was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider\n",
      "whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the\n",
      "pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing\n",
      "to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather\n",
      "dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the\n",
      "instrument’s coming if she could.”\n",
      "After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill’s\n",
      "confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\n",
      "more than a word in passing.\n",
      "“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”—was then his remark. “You did behave\n",
      "very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And having gone through\n",
      "what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\n",
      "persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax’s sense of\n",
      "right, he made a fuller pause to say, “This is very bad.—He had induced\n",
      "her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme\n",
      "difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to\n",
      "prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—She must have had much more\n",
      "to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He\n",
      "should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;\n",
      "but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and\n",
      "remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the\n",
      "engagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of\n",
      "punishment.”\n",
      "Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\n",
      "uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\n",
      "deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\n",
      "however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\n",
      "excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\n",
      "of giving pain—no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\n",
      "“There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\n",
      "Eltons,” was his next observation.—“His feelings are natural.—What!\n",
      "actually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the engagement to\n",
      "be a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it.—What a\n",
      "view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!—Well, he must be a most\n",
      "extraordinary—”\n",
      "“Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers.”\n",
      "“I hope he does,” replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the\n",
      "letter. “‘Smallridge!’—What does this mean? What is all this?”\n",
      "“She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge’s children—a\n",
      "dear friend of Mrs. Elton’s—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\n",
      "bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?”\n",
      "“Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of\n",
      "Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\n",
      "the man writes!”\n",
      "“I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.”\n",
      "“Well, there _is_ feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered in\n",
      "finding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\n",
      "her. ‘Dearer, much dearer than ever.’ I hope he may long continue to\n",
      "feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a very liberal\n",
      "thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.—‘Happier than I\n",
      "deserve.’ Come, he knows himself there. ‘Miss Woodhouse calls me the\n",
      "child of good fortune.’—Those were Miss Woodhouse’s words, were they?—\n",
      "And a fine ending—and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\n",
      "That was your name for him, was it?”\n",
      "“You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\n",
      "you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\n",
      "hope it does him some service with you.”\n",
      "“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\n",
      "inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\n",
      "in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\n",
      "is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\n",
      "may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am\n",
      "very ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers\n",
      "the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me\n",
      "talk to you of something else. I have another person’s interest at\n",
      "present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank\n",
      "Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been\n",
      "hard at work on one subject.”\n",
      "The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\n",
      "English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\n",
      "with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\n",
      "happiness of her father. Emma’s answer was ready at the first word.\n",
      "“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be\n",
      "impossible for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this\n",
      "answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her\n",
      "father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the\n",
      "inadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been\n",
      "thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to\n",
      "induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to\n",
      "believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not\n",
      "suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his\n",
      "persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father’s\n",
      "comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt that it ought not to be\n",
      "attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he\n",
      "trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\n",
      "it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her\n",
      "father’s happiness—in other words, his life—required Hartfield to\n",
      "continue her home, it should be his likewise.\n",
      "Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\n",
      "thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\n",
      "an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\n",
      "the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\n",
      "be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\n",
      "in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\n",
      "would be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of\n",
      "it, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced,\n",
      "that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the\n",
      "subject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm\n",
      "consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole\n",
      "morning, to have his thoughts to himself.\n",
      "“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I am sure\n",
      "William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\n",
      "ask mine.”\n",
      "She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\n",
      "moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\n",
      "scheme.\n",
      "It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\n",
      "which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck\n",
      "with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\n",
      "heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she\n",
      "must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she\n",
      "only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement\n",
      "in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley’s\n",
      "marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\n",
      "wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\n",
      "This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\n",
      "Hartfield—the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\n",
      "His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their\n",
      "mutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in\n",
      "the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in\n",
      "all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\n",
      "melancholy!\n",
      "She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\n",
      "of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\n",
      "who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\n",
      "party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\n",
      "charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\n",
      "every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\n",
      "from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead\n",
      "weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\n",
      "peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state\n",
      "of unmerited punishment.\n",
      "In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\n",
      "supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\n",
      "Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like\n",
      "Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\n",
      "considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\n",
      "than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\n",
      "could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\n",
      "herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\n",
      "letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\n",
      "Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\n",
      "reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\n",
      "was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her\n",
      "style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—It\n",
      "might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only\n",
      "could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\n",
      "She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella’s invitation; and she was\n",
      "fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without\n",
      "resorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished,\n",
      "and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\n",
      "delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\n",
      "her—and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\n",
      "quite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on\n",
      "her sister’s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very\n",
      "persuadable.—Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\n",
      "fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse’s carriage.—It was\n",
      "all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\n",
      "Square.\n",
      "Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she could\n",
      "talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\n",
      "of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted\n",
      "her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much\n",
      "might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the\n",
      "feelings which she had led astray herself.\n",
      "The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s, or in London, made perhaps\n",
      "an unreasonable difference in Emma’s sensations; but she could not\n",
      "think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\n",
      "which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\n",
      "She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\n",
      "in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication\n",
      "before her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make—the\n",
      "confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing\n",
      "to do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till\n",
      "Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be\n",
      "thrown at this period among those she loved—and the evil should not act\n",
      "on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A fortnight, at\n",
      "least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more\n",
      "agitating, delight, should be hers.\n",
      "She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\n",
      "hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought\n",
      "to go—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\n",
      "situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\n",
      "_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of\n",
      "prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should\n",
      "attend to any thing Jane might communicate.\n",
      "She went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\n",
      "been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane\n",
      "had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all\n",
      "the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being\n",
      "still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home,\n",
      "to wait in the passage, and send up her name.—She heard Patty\n",
      "announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had\n",
      "before made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard nothing but the\n",
      "instant reply of, “Beg her to walk up;”—and a moment afterwards she was\n",
      "met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no\n",
      "other reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her\n",
      "look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,\n",
      "animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or\n",
      "manner could ever have wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand;\n",
      "and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,\n",
      "“This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to\n",
      "express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely without\n",
      "words.”\n",
      "Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\n",
      "sound of Mrs. Elton’s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her,\n",
      "and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\n",
      "congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\n",
      "Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\n",
      "accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\n",
      "Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\n",
      "body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped\n",
      "the rencontre would do them no harm.\n",
      "She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton’s thoughts, and\n",
      "understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\n",
      "Miss Fairfax’s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what\n",
      "was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately\n",
      "in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to\n",
      "Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady’s replies, she\n",
      "saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which\n",
      "she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it\n",
      "into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant\n",
      "nods,\n",
      "“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\n",
      "opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already.\n",
      "I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\n",
      "not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\n",
      "creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.—But not a word\n",
      "more. Let us be discreet—quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You\n",
      "remember those lines—I forget the poem at this moment:\n",
      "“For when a lady’s in the case,\n",
      "“You know all other things give place.”\n",
      "Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read——mum! a word to the\n",
      "wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I? But I want to set your\n",
      "heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My_ representation, you see, has quite\n",
      "appeased her.”\n",
      "And again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates’s\n",
      "knitting, she added, in a half whisper,\n",
      "“I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a\n",
      "minister of state. I managed it extremely well.”\n",
      "Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\n",
      "possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony\n",
      "of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed\n",
      "with,\n",
      "“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\n",
      "charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\n",
      "credit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\n",
      "word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh! if you had\n",
      "seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!”—And when Mrs. Bates was\n",
      "saying something to Emma, whispered farther, “We do not say a word of\n",
      "any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\n",
      "physician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.”\n",
      "“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,” she\n",
      "shortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\n",
      "party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\n",
      "seem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So\n",
      "it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\n",
      "it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to\n",
      "our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while\n",
      "the fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party, you know, quite the\n",
      "same party, not _one_ exception.”\n",
      "Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\n",
      "diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\n",
      "she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\n",
      "every thing.\n",
      "“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is impossible\n",
      "to say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane’s prospects—that\n",
      "is, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little\n",
      "circle as you find us here.—Yes, indeed.—Charming young man!—that is—so\n",
      "very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And from\n",
      "her great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton\n",
      "for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of\n",
      "resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now\n",
      "graciously overcome.—After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it\n",
      "beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\n",
      "“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\n",
      "anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\n",
      "is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\n",
      "here, and pay his respects to you.”\n",
      "“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will\n",
      "be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits,\n",
      "and Mr. Elton’s time is so engaged.”\n",
      "“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to\n",
      "night.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some pretence or\n",
      "other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\n",
      "wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\n",
      "him.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you than I.—I do not\n",
      "know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half\n",
      "so many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them\n",
      "both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this\n",
      "fortnight.—However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose\n",
      "to wait on you all.” And putting up her hand to screen her words from\n",
      "Emma—“A congratulatory visit, you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.”\n",
      "Miss Bates looked about her, so happily—!\n",
      "“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from\n",
      "Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\n",
      "consultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.”\n",
      "Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton\n",
      "gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.”\n",
      "“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\n",
      "Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\n",
      "lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.”\n",
      "“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma. “I am almost certain that\n",
      "the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley was at\n",
      "Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”\n",
      "“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer, which\n",
      "denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton’s side.—“I do\n",
      "believe,” she continued, “this is the most troublesome parish that ever\n",
      "was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.”\n",
      "“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.\n",
      "“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\n",
      "talked of.”\n",
      "“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\n",
      "you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;\n",
      "the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”\n",
      "“Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true. What a thinking brain you\n",
      "have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if\n",
      "we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would\n",
      "produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that\n",
      "_some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.—But hush!—not a\n",
      "word, if you please.”\n",
      "It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\n",
      "not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\n",
      "The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\n",
      "evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\n",
      "Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\n",
      "sparkling vivacity.\n",
      "“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\n",
      "encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But\n",
      "you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I\n",
      "should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been\n",
      "sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\n",
      "obedience—for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?”\n",
      "Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\n",
      "His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\n",
      "object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and\n",
      "the walk he had had for nothing.\n",
      "“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be found. Very\n",
      "odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and\n",
      "the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.”\n",
      "“Donwell!” cried his wife.—“My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\n",
      "Donwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.”\n",
      "“No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\n",
      "to-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went\n",
      "over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\n",
      "it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I\n",
      "am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\n",
      "housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very\n",
      "extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to\n",
      "Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it?”\n",
      "Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\n",
      "indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\n",
      "“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\n",
      "ought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\n",
      "all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\n",
      "be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\n",
      "sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his\n",
      "servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\n",
      "to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often\n",
      "observed, extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such\n",
      "a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.\n",
      "And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She\n",
      "promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.”\n",
      "“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near the house,\n",
      "and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\n",
      "believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\n",
      "was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get\n",
      "the speech of him. I have nothing to do with William’s wants, but it\n",
      "really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley\n",
      "to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious\n",
      "inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.”\n",
      "Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all\n",
      "probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\n",
      "Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\n",
      "Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\n",
      "She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\n",
      "attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\n",
      "an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\n",
      "“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\n",
      "not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\n",
      "introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\n",
      "have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been\n",
      "impertinent.”\n",
      "“Oh!” cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\n",
      "infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\n",
      "composure—“there would have been no danger. The danger would have been\n",
      "of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by\n",
      "expressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\n",
      "collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\n",
      "great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\n",
      "of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\n",
      "disgusted to such a degree as to—I have not time for half that I could\n",
      "wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\n",
      "myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately—in short, if your\n",
      "compassion does not stand my friend—”\n",
      "“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly, and\n",
      "taking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\n",
      "might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\n",
      "even—”\n",
      "“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and\n",
      "artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know\n",
      "that I must have disgusted you.”\n",
      "“Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\n",
      "Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\n",
      "quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\n",
      "have pleasant accounts from Windsor?”\n",
      "“Very.”\n",
      "“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—just as\n",
      "I begin to know you.”\n",
      "“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\n",
      "till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\n",
      "“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,\n",
      "smiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”\n",
      "The smile was returned as Jane answered,\n",
      "“You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\n",
      "am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\n",
      "at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\n",
      "deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\n",
      "more to wait for.”\n",
      "“Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh!\n",

      "CHAPTER XVII\n",
      "Mrs. Weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\n",
      "satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\n",
      "knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\n",
      "wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\n",
      "any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of\n",
      "Isabella’s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both\n",
      "father and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as\n",
      "he grew older—and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years\n",
      "hence—to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,\n",
      "the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;\n",
      "and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to\n",
      "teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.\n",
      "“She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she\n",
      "continued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis, in Madame\n",
      "de Genlis’ Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\n",
      "Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”\n",
      "“That is,” replied Mr. Knightley, “she will indulge her even more than\n",
      "she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\n",
      "be the only difference.”\n",
      "“Poor child!” cried Emma; “at that rate, what will become of her?”\n",
      "“Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in\n",
      "infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\n",
      "bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing\n",
      "all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me\n",
      "to be severe on them?”\n",
      "Emma laughed, and replied: “But I had the assistance of all your\n",
      "endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt\n",
      "whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.”\n",
      "“Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor\n",
      "gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\n",
      "as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\n",
      "right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to\n",
      "feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\n",
      "you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of\n",
      "the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much\n",
      "without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many\n",
      "errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at\n",
      "least.”\n",
      "“I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma. “I was very often\n",
      "influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I am\n",
      "very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\n",
      "spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\n",
      "as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\n",
      "thirteen.”\n",
      "“How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\n",
      "saucy looks—‘Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\n",
      "may, or I have Miss Taylor’s leave’—something which, you knew, I did\n",
      "not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\n",
      "feelings instead of one.”\n",
      "“What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches\n",
      "in such affectionate remembrance.”\n",
      "“‘Mr. Knightley.’—You always called me, ‘Mr. Knightley;’ and, from\n",
      "habit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal. I want\n",
      "you to call me something else, but I do not know what.”\n",
      "“I remember once calling you ‘George,’ in one of my amiable fits, about\n",
      "ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\n",
      "you made no objection, I never did it again.”\n",
      "“And cannot you call me ‘George’ now?”\n",
      "“Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr. Knightley.’ I will\n",
      "not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\n",
      "calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise,” she added presently, laughing\n",
      "and blushing—“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I\n",
      "do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in\n",
      "which N. takes M. for better, for worse.”\n",
      "Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\n",
      "service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice\n",
      "which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\n",
      "follies—her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\n",
      "subject.—She could not enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned\n",
      "between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not\n",
      "being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to\n",
      "delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship\n",
      "were declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\n",
      "circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\n",
      "her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\n",
      "Isabella’s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\n",
      "obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior\n",
      "to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\n",
      "Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\n",
      "expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\n",
      "which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be\n",
      "consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear\n",
      "to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.—Isabella,\n",
      "to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been\n",
      "equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her.\n",
      "Emma’s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet’s\n",
      "being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was\n",
      "invited to remain till they could bring her back.\n",
      "“John does not even mention your friend,” said Mr. Knightley. “Here is\n",
      "his answer, if you like to see it.”\n",
      "It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\n",
      "accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to\n",
      "know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that\n",
      "her friend was unmentioned.\n",
      "“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, “but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to\n",
      "have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from\n",
      "making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\n",
      "cool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.”\n",
      "“He writes like a sensible man,” replied Emma, when she had read the\n",
      "letter. “I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\n",
      "good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\n",
      "without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\n",
      "you think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\n",
      "construction, I should not have believed him.”\n",
      "“My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—”\n",
      "“He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,”\n",
      "interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile—“much less, perhaps, than\n",
      "he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\n",
      "subject.”\n",
      "“Emma, my dear Emma—”\n",
      "“Oh!” she cried with more thorough gaiety, “if you fancy your brother\n",
      "does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\n",
      "and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from\n",
      "doing _you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the\n",
      "advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish\n",
      "I may not sink into ‘poor Emma’ with him at once.—His tender compassion\n",
      "towards oppressed worth can go no farther.”\n",
      "“Ah!” he cried, “I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\n",
      "as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\n",
      "to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did you\n",
      "notice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly\n",
      "by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of\n",
      "the kind.”\n",
      "“If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some\n",
      "thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\n",
      "unprepared for that.”\n",
      "“Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\n",
      "feelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any\n",
      "difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this\n",
      "time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I\n",
      "suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\n",
      "the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\n",
      "as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, ‘Uncle seems\n",
      "always tired now.’”\n",
      "The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\n",
      "persons’ reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\n",
      "recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse’s visits, Emma having it in view that\n",
      "her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first\n",
      "to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to\n",
      "her father at last!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of\n",
      "Mr. Knightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would\n",
      "have failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to\n",
      "come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She\n",
      "was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it\n",
      "a more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\n",
      "She must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she\n",
      "could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\n",
      "in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\n",
      "obtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\n",
      "since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and Mr.\n",
      "Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\n",
      "constant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he loved, next\n",
      "to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\n",
      "Poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\n",
      "earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\n",
      "having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\n",
      "a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor\n",
      "Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about\n",
      "him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he\n",
      "must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\n",
      "taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but\n",
      "she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was\n",
      "introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the\n",
      "better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier\n",
      "for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to\n",
      "the idea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny\n",
      "that he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business\n",
      "but Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his\n",
      "letters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so\n",
      "attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the spot?—Yes.\n",
      "That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he\n",
      "should be glad to see him every day;—but they did see him every day as\n",
      "it was.—Why could not they go on as they had done?\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\n",
      "the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To\n",
      "Emma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley’s, whose fond\n",
      "praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\n",
      "used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the\n",
      "assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\n",
      "approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\n",
      "consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled,\n",
      "and, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance\n",
      "of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse’s mind.—It was agreed upon,\n",
      "as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided\n",
      "assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\n",
      "feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\n",
      "time or other—in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be so very\n",
      "bad if the marriage did take place.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\n",
      "said to him in favour of the event.—She had been extremely surprized,\n",
      "never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\n",
      "saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\n",
      "urging him to the utmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\n",
      "to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\n",
      "so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\n",
      "respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\n",
      "so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\n",
      "have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\n",
      "been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\n",
      "long ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\n",
      "would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\n",
      "Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an\n",
      "arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for\n",
      "a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\n",
      "and Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr.\n",
      "Weston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the\n",
      "subject better than by saying—“Those matters will take care of\n",
      "themselves; the young people will find a way.” But here there was\n",
      "nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\n",
      "all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the\n",
      "name. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and\n",
      "without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\n",
      "as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing\n",
      "could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon\n",
      "have outgrown its first set of caps.\n",
      "The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\n",
      "had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\n",
      "familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of\n",
      "the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but\n",
      "the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\n",
      "was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\n",
      "“It is to be a secret, I conclude,” said he. “These matters are always\n",
      "a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me\n",
      "be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.”\n",
      "He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\n",
      "point. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\n",
      "daughter?—he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of\n",
      "course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\n",
      "afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\n",
      "had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon\n",
      "it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the\n",
      "evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\n",
      "In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,\n",
      "and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend\n",
      "their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John\n",
      "Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their\n",
      "servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection\n",
      "raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.—There, the surprize was\n",
      "not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,\n",
      "compared with his wife; he only hoped “the young lady’s pride would now\n",
      "be contented;” and supposed “she had always meant to catch Knightley if\n",
      "she could;” and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly\n",
      "exclaim, “Rather he than I!”—But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed\n",
      "indeed.—“Poor Knightley! poor fellow!—sad business for him.”—She was\n",
      "extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\n",
      "qualities.—How could he be so taken in?—Did not think him at all in\n",
      "love—not in the least.—Poor Knightley!—There would be an end of all\n",
      "pleasant intercourse with him.—How happy he had been to come and dine\n",
      "with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.—Poor\n",
      "fellow!—No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh! no;\n",
      "there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\n",
      "thing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that she\n",
      "had abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan, living\n",
      "together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who had\n",
      "tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVIII\n",
      "Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\n",
      "be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\n",
      "morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her,\n",
      "when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After\n",
      "the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone,\n",
      "began with,\n",
      "“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”\n",
      "“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\n",
      "“I do not know which it ought to be called.”\n",
      "“Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\n",
      "to smile.”\n",
      "“I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very much afraid,\n",
      "my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”\n",
      "“Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\n",
      "or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”\n",
      "“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not\n",
      "think alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\n",
      "her face. “Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet\n",
      "Smith.”\n",
      "Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\n",
      "though she knew not what.\n",
      "“Have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “You have, I\n",
      "believe, and know the whole.”\n",
      "“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”\n",
      "“You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet\n",
      "Smith marries Robert Martin.”\n",
      "Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes,\n",
      "in eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were\n",
      "closed.\n",
      "“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from Robert\n",
      "Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”\n",
      "She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\n",
      "“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were\n",
      "the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\n",
      "or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need\n",
      "not talk much on the subject.”\n",
      "“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself.\n",
      "“It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\n",
      "cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say,\n",
      "that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\n",
      "has even proposed to her again—yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”\n",
      "“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\n",
      "determined decision, “and been accepted.”\n",
      "“Good God!” she cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket,\n",
      "in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\n",
      "feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\n",
      "expressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this\n",
      "intelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was\n",
      "more surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.—How—how\n",
      "has it been possible?”\n",
      "“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\n",
      "and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\n",
      "to John.—He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\n",
      "asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley’s. They\n",
      "were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley’s. The party was to be\n",
      "our brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert\n",
      "could not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely\n",
      "amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day—which\n",
      "he did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\n",
      "opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in\n",
      "vain.—She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\n",
      "deserving. He came down by yesterday’s coach, and was with me this\n",
      "morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\n",
      "on my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\n",
      "the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer\n",
      "history when you see her.—She will give you all the minute particulars,\n",
      "which only woman’s language can make interesting.—In our communications\n",
      "we deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s\n",
      "heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did\n",
      "mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\n",
      "box at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and\n",
      "little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one\n",
      "time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.”\n",
      "He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\n",
      "was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\n",
      "She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence\n",
      "disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\n",
      "“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\n",
      "unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\n",
      "situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your\n",
      "friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as\n",
      "you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\n",
      "you.—As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in\n",
      "better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\n",
      "saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William\n",
      "Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”\n",
      "He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\n",
      "to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,\n",
      "“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\n",
      "Harriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\n",
      "_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\n",
      "are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\n",
      "cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\n",
      "unprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more\n",
      "determined against him, much more, than she was before.”\n",
      "“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I\n",
      "should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\n",
      "very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”\n",
      "Emma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe\n",
      "you know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you\n",
      "perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him. I\n",
      "could suppose she might in time—but can she already?—Did not you\n",
      "misunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things; of business,\n",
      "shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of\n",
      "so many subjects, mistake him?—It was not Harriet’s hand that he was\n",
      "certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”\n",
      "The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\n",
      "Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma’s feelings, and so\n",
      "strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on\n",
      "Harriet’s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such\n",
      "emphasis, “No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,”\n",
      "that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some\n",
      "measure, premature. It could not be otherwise.\n",
      "“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to suppose me\n",
      "so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?—What do\n",
      "you deserve?”\n",
      "“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\n",
      "any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\n",
      "you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\n",
      "Harriet now are?”\n",
      "“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he told\n",
      "me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\n",
      "doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\n",
      "it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\n",
      "of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\n",
      "her relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be\n",
      "done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,\n",
      "he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”\n",
      "“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\n",
      "“and most sincerely wish them happy.”\n",
      "“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”\n",
      "“I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.”\n",
      "“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\n",
      "Harriet’s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and\n",
      "for Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as\n",
      "much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have\n",
      "often talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.\n",
      "Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of\n",
      "pleading poor Martin’s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\n",
      "my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\n",
      "with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her\n",
      "happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.—Much of this,\n",
      "I have no doubt, she may thank you for.”\n",
      "“Me!” cried Emma, shaking her head.—“Ah! poor Harriet!”\n",
      "She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\n",
      "praise than she deserved.\n",
      "Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\n",
      "father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\n",
      "state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\n",
      "collected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till\n",
      "she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,\n",
      "she could be fit for nothing rational.\n",
      "Her father’s business was to announce James’s being gone out to put the\n",
      "horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\n",
      "had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\n",
      "The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\n",
      "imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\n",
      "Harriet’s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\n",
      "security.—What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\n",
      "him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her\n",
      "own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her\n",
      "humility and circumspection in future.\n",
      "Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\n",
      "resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\n",
      "very midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\n",
      "doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!\n",
      "Now there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would be a\n",
      "pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\n",
      "High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\n",
      "reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\n",
      "soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\n",
      "practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\n",
      "that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready\n",
      "to welcome as a duty.\n",
      "In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\n",
      "always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\n",
      "speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being\n",
      "obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\n",
      "disappointed.\n",
      "They arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had\n",
      "they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for\n",
      "coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\n",
      "blind, of two figures passing near the window.\n",
      "“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just going to\n",
      "tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.\n",
      "He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend\n",
      "the day with us.—They are coming in, I hope.”\n",
      "In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see\n",
      "him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing\n",
      "recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\n",
      "consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\n",
      "sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,\n",
      "that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had\n",
      "long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with\n",
      "Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined\n",
      "the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer\n",
      "a want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for Frank\n",
      "Churchill to draw near her and say,\n",
      "“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\n",
      "in one of Mrs. Weston’s letters. I hope time has not made you less\n",
      "willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”\n",
      "“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. I am\n",
      "particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy\n",
      "in person.”\n",
      "He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\n",
      "with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\n",
      "“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n",
      "“Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "doat upon her.”\n",
      "But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\n",
      "mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\n",
      "Dixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\n",
      "“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”\n",
      "“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\n",
      "possible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know, you\n",
      "had none.”\n",
      "“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”\n",
      "“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I had—it\n",
      "would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things,\n",
      "they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.—It\n",
      "would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of\n",
      "secrecy and told you every thing.”\n",
      "“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.\n",
      "“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle’s being persuaded to pay a\n",
      "visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\n",
      "are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I\n",
      "trust, till we may carry her northward.—But now, I am at such a\n",
      "distance from her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we\n",
      "have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”\n",
      "Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\n",
      "thought, he cried,\n",
      "“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\n",
      "moment—“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He paused.—She coloured and\n",
      "laughed.—“I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\n",
      "in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.—I assure you that I\n",
      "have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—He is a\n",
      "man whom I cannot presume to praise.”\n",
      "Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\n",
      "his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\n",
      "and his next words were,\n",
      "“Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—and yet\n",
      "without being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It is a most\n",
      "uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair—a most\n",
      "distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.—Just colour\n",
      "enough for beauty.”\n",
      "“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly; “but do\n",
      "not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\n",
      "pale?—When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite forgotten?”\n",
      "“Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—”\n",
      "But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not\n",
      "help saying,\n",
      "“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\n",
      "had very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I am\n",
      "sure it was a consolation to you.”\n",
      "“Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\n",
      "miserable wretch!”\n",
      "“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was\n",
      "a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\n",
      "all in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\n",
      "truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\n",
      "situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.”\n",
      "He bowed.\n",
      "“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of true\n",
      "sensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which\n",
      "bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our\n",
      "own.”\n",
      "“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your side. You can\n",
      "have no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete angel. Look\n",
      "at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\n",
      "throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.—You will\n",
      "be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\n",
      "uncle means to give her all my aunt’s jewels. They are to be new set. I\n",
      "am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\n",
      "beautiful in her dark hair?”\n",
      "“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that\n",
      "he gratefully burst out,\n",
      "“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\n",
      "looks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\n",
      "certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.”\n",
      "The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\n",
      "of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\n",
      "infant’s appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\n",
      "but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of\n",
      "sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston\n",
      "had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes, however, the\n",
      "child had been perfectly well again. This was her history; and\n",
      "particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her\n",
      "very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that\n",
      "she had not done it. “She should always send for Perry, if the child\n",
      "appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.\n",
      "She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was\n",
      "a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child\n",
      "seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been\n",
      "better if Perry had seen it.”\n",
      "Frank Churchill caught the name.\n",
      "“Perry!” said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\n",
      "Fairfax’s eye. “My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\n",
      "Perry?—Has he been here this morning?—And how does he travel now?—Has\n",
      "he set up his carriage?”\n",
      "Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\n",
      "laugh, it was evident from Jane’s countenance that she too was really\n",
      "hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\n",
      "“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never think of\n",
      "it without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\n",
      "it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\n",
      "not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\n",
      "which sent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole\n",
      "blunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else,\n",
      "though pretending to listen to the others?”\n",
      "Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\n",
      "remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\n",
      "steady voice,\n",
      "“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They _will_\n",
      "sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!”\n",
      "He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\n",
      "Emma’s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\n",
      "Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\n",
      "felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\n",
      "regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\n",
      "sensible of Mr. Knightley’s high superiority of character. The\n",
      "happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\n",
      "animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIX\n",
      "If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\n",
      "momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\n",
      "attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\n",
      "unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\n",
      "recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\n",
      "from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\n",
      "alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied—unaccountable\n",
      "as it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "and was now forming all her views of happiness.\n",
      "Harriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but\n",
      "having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\n",
      "self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\n",
      "the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\n",
      "fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend’s\n",
      "approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\n",
      "meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—Harriet was most\n",
      "happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley’s, and the\n",
      "dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\n",
      "But what did such particulars explain?—The fact was, as Emma could now\n",
      "acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\n",
      "continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this, it must ever\n",
      "be unintelligible to Emma.\n",
      "The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\n",
      "reason for thinking so.—Harriet’s parentage became known. She proved to\n",
      "be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\n",
      "comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\n",
      "have always wished for concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility\n",
      "which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be\n",
      "as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a\n",
      "connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley—or for the\n",
      "Churchills—or even for Mr. Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached\n",
      "by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\n",
      "No objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated\n",
      "liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\n",
      "with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\n",
      "acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\n",
      "bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet’s\n",
      "happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\n",
      "offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\n",
      "improvement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\n",
      "and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and\n",
      "occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\n",
      "temptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\n",
      "and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\n",
      "world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\n",
      "man;—or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\n",
      "Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\n",
      "was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.—The\n",
      "intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\n",

      "FINIS\n",
      "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her. She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection. Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own. The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her. Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor’s loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost. The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault. How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful. The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time. Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again. Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner, “Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!” “I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?” “A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my dear.” “How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon.” “My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far.” “No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure.” “The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?” “They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!” “I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are.” Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary. Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after some days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.” “Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.” “But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold.” “Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.” “Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.” “By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?” “Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.” “Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say ‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.” “Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.” “I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.” “My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.” Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body. “Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a gainer.” “Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.” “Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.” Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr. Knightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married.” “And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.” Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.” “I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it. “Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.” “I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley. “Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.” “And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.” “A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference.” “Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family circle grievously.” “Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a service.” “Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.” “With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley, laughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”\n",
      "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\n",
      "of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\n",
      "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\n",
      "first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\n",

      "“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\n",
      "told me all about it.”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n",
      "“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\n",
      "“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\n",
      "This was invitation enough.\n",
      "“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\n",

      "down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\n",
      "delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\n",

      "“Is he married or single?”\n",
      "“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\n",
      "five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\n",
      "“How so? how can it affect them?”\n",
      "“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\n",
      "must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\n",
      "“Is that his design in settling here?”\n",
      "“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n",
      "_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\n",
      "soon as he comes.”\n",
      "“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\n",
      "them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\n",
      "as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\n",
      "party.”\n",
      "“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\n",
      "I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\n",
      "grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\n",
      "“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\n",
      "“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\n",
      "the neighbourhood.”\n",
      "“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\n",
      "“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\n",
      "be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\n",
      "merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\n",
      "comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\n",
      "him, if you do not.”\n",
      "“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\n",
      "glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\n",
      "hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\n",
      "I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\n",
      "“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\n",
      "others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\n",
      "good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\n",
      "“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\n",
      "all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\n",
      "quickness than her sisters.”\n",
      "“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\n",
      "delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\n",
      "“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\n",
      "are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\n",
      "these twenty years at least.”\n",
      "“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\n",
      "“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\n",

      "all.”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n",
      "reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\n",
      "been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\n",
      "was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\n",
      "little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\n",
      "fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\n",
      "daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\n",
      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\n",

      "wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\n",
      "paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\n",
      "manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\n",
      "suddenly addressed her with,--\n",
      "“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\n",
      "“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\n",
      "resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\n",

      "assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\n",
      "“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\n",
      "of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\n",
      "of her.”\n",
      "“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\n",
      "not depend on her serving you.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\n",
      "herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n",
      "“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\n",
      "compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\n",
      "“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\n",

      "“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\n",
      "the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\n",
      "she will not know him herself.”\n",
      "“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\n",
      "Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\n",
      "“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\n",
      "myself; how can you be so teasing?”\n",
      "“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\n",
      "very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\n",
      "fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\n",
      "all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\n",
      "as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\n",
      "will take it on myself.”\n",
      "The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\n",
      "nonsense!”\n",
      "“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\n",
      "you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\n",
      "them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\n",
      "Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\n",
      "great books, and make extracts.”\n",
      "Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n",
      "“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\n",
      "Bingley.”\n",
      "“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\n",
      "“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\n",
      "had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\n",
      "him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\n",
      "cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\n",
      "The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\n",
      "was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\n",
      "while.\n",
      "“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\n",
      "persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\n",
      "neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\n",
      "good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\n",
      "word about it till now.”\n",
      "“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\n",
      "as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n",
      "“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\n",
      "shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\n",
      "or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\n",
      "pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\n",
      "for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\n",
      "the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\n",
      "ball.”\n",
      "“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\n",
      "youngest, I’m the tallest.”\n",
      "The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\n",
      "return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\n",
      "daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\n",
      "husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\n",
      "in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\n",
      "distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\n",
      "last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\n",
      "Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\n",
      "delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\n",
      "agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\n",
      "with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\n",
      "dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\n",
      "hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\n",
      "“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\n",
      "said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\n",
      "married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\n",
      "In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\n",
      "minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\n",
      "admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\n",
      "much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\n",
      "fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\n",
      "window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\n",
      "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\n",
      "housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\n",
      "was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\n",
      "accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\n",
      "disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\n",
      "so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\n",
      "he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\n",
      "settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\n",
      "little by starting the idea of his\n",
      "being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\n",
      "report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\n",
      "seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\n",
      "number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\n",
      "that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\n",
      "his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\n",
      "assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\n",
      "two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n",
      "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\n",
      "countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\n",
      "with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\n",
      "looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\n",
      "of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\n",
      "the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\n",
      "his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\n",
      "pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\n",
      "much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\n",
      "admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\n",
      "which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\n",
      "proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\n",
      "large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\n",
      "disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\n",
      "people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\n",
      "was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\n",
      "himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\n",
      "themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\n",
      "only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\n",
      "introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\n",
      "walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\n",
      "His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\n",
      "the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\n",
      "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\n",
      "his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\n",
      "having slighted one of her daughters.\n",
      "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\n",
      "down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\n",
      "standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\n",
      "Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\n",
      "friend to join it.\n",
      "“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\n",
      "standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\n",
      "dance.”\n",
      "“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\n",
      "particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\n",
      "would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\n",
      "another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\n",
      "stand up with.”\n",
      "“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a\n",
      "kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\n",
      "life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\n",
      "uncommonly pretty.”\n",
      "“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\n",
      "Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n",
      "“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\n",
      "of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\n",
      "dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\n",
      "“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\n",
      "Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\n",
      "“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\n",
      "humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\n",
      "by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\n",
      "smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\n",
      "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\n",
      "remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\n",
      "however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\n",
      "playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\n",
      "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\n",
      "party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\n",
      "distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\n",
      "mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\n",
      "pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\n",
      "accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\n",
      "fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\n",
      "had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\n",
      "spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\n",
      "were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\n",
      "book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\n",
      "good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\n",
      "such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\n",
      "views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\n",
      "had a very different story to hear.\n",
      "“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\n",
      "delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\n",
      "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\n",
      "she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\n",
      "her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\n",
      "twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\n",
      "time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\n",
      "up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\n",
      "can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\n",
      "down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\n",
      "asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\n",
      "King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\n",
      "again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\n",
      "“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\n",
      "“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\n",
      "his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\n",
      "“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\n",
      "is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\n",
      "in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\n",
      "lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”\n",
      "Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\n",
      "description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\n",
      "of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\n",
      "exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\n",
      "suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\n",
      "all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\n",
      "him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\n",
      "great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\n",
      "dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\n",
      "CHAPTER IV.\n",
      "When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\n",
      "her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\n",
      "she admired him.\n",
      "“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\n",
      "good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\n",
      "with such perfect good breeding!”\n",
      "“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\n",
      "likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\n",
      "“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\n",
      "did not expect such a compliment.”\n",
      "“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\n",
      "us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\n",
      "could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\n",
      "seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\n",
      "the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\n",
      "very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\n",
      "stupider person.”\n",
      "“Dear Lizzy!”\n",
      "“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\n",
      "You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\n",
      "in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”\n",
      "“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\n",
      "what I think.”\n",
      "“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\n",
      "good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\n",
      "others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\n",
      "everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\n",
      "good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\n",
      "of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\n",
      "too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”\n",
      "“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\n",
      "converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\n",
      "his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\n",
      "neighbour in her.”\n",
      "Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\n",
      "the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\n",
      "quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\n",
      "with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\n",
      "very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\n",
      "ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\n",
      "power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\n",
      "They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\n",
      "seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\n",
      "habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\n",
      "of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\n",
      "themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\n",
      "the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\n",
      "memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\n",
      "acquired by trade.\n",
      "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\n",
      "thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\n",
      "but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\n",
      "sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\n",
      "good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\n",
      "who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\n",
      "remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\n",
      "purchase.\n",
      "His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\n",
      "though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\n",
      "means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\n",
      "married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\n",
      "his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\n",
      "age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\n",
      "look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\n",
      "hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\n",
      "with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\n",
      "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\n",
      "great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\n",
      "easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\n",
      "could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\n",
      "never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\n",
      "had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\n",
      "understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\n",
      "deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\n",
      "reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\n",
      "inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\n",
      "was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\n",
      "giving offence.\n",
      "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\n",
      "characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\n",
      "girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\n",
      "there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\n",
      "with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\n",
      "more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\n",
      "in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\n",
      "felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\n",
      "pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\n",
      "much.\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\n",
      "her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\n",
      "they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\n",
      "established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\n",
      "commendation to think of her as he chose.\n",
      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\n",
      "were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\n",
      "in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\n",
      "honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\n",
      "distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\n",
      "disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\n",
      "and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\n",
      "a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\n",
      "could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\n",
      "business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\n",
      "though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\n",
      "contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\n",
      "friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\n",
      "courteous.\n",
      "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\n",
      "valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\n",
      "of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\n",
      "Elizabeth’s intimate friend.\n",
      "That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\n",
      "ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\n",
      "brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n",
      "“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\n",
      "self-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”\n",
      "“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\n",
      "“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\n",
      "sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\n",
      "_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\n",
      "about Mr. Robinson.”\n",
      "“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\n",
      "I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\n",
      "assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\n",
      "women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\n",
      "answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\n",
      "beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\n",
      "“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\n",
      "if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\n",
      "“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\n",
      "Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\n",
      "is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”\n",
      "“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\n",
      "ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\n",
      "a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\n",
      "sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”\n",
      "“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\n",
      "“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\n",
      "“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\n",
      "could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\n",
      "spoke to.”\n",
      "“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\n",
      "among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\n",
      "agreeable.”\n",
      "“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\n",
      "agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\n",
      "was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\n",
      "heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\n",
      "to the ball in a hack chaise.”\n",
      "“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\n",
      "wish he had danced with Eliza.”\n",
      "“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\n",
      "if I were you.”\n",
      "“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”\n",
      "“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\n",
      "often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\n",
      "very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\n",
      "should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\n",
      "to be proud.”\n",
      "“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\n",
      "_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\n",
      "“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\n",
      "reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\n",
      "ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\n",
      "nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\n",
      "who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\n",
      "quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\n",
      "things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\n",
      "proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\n",
      "ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\n",
      "“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\n",
      "sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\n",
      "foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\n",
      "“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\n",
      "directly.”\n",
      "The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\n",
      "would; and the argument ended only with the visit.\n",
      "CHAPTER VI.\n",
      "The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\n",
      "was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\n",
      "good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\n",
      "found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\n",
      "a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\n",
      "two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\n",
      "pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\n",
      "everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\n",
      "though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\n",
      "in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\n",
      "was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\n",
      "to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\n",
      "which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\n",
      "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\n",
      "was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\n",
      "united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\n",
      "uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\n",
      "suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\n",
      "Lucas.\n",
      "“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\n",
      "on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\n",
      "so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\n",
      "from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\n",
      "it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\n",
      "dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\n",
      "attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n",
      "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n",
      "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\n",
      "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\n",
      "affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\n",
      "may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\n",
      "“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\n",
      "perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\n",
      "discover it too.”\n",
      "“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\n",
      "“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\n",
      "it, he must find it out.”\n",
      "“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\n",
      "meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\n",
      "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\n",
      "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\n",
      "therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\n",
      "attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\n",
      "in love as much as she chooses.”\n",
      "“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\n",
      "question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\n",
      "to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\n",
      "these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\n",
      "cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\n",
      "reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\n",
      "dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\n",
      "and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\n",
      "enough to make her understand his character.”\n",
      "“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\n",
      "only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\n",
      "remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\n",
      "evenings may do a great deal.”\n",
      "“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\n",
      "like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\n",
      "leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\n",
      "“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\n",
      "she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\n",
      "chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\n",
      "twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\n",
      "the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\n",
      "ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\n",
      "least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\n",
      "have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\n",
      "possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\n",
      "life.”\n",
      "“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\n",
      "sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\n",
      "Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\n",
      "was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\n",
      "interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\n",
      "allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\n",
      "ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\n",
      "sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\n",
      "hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\n",
      "uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\n",
      "this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\n",
      "detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\n",
      "in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\n",
      "pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\n",
      "of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\n",
      "this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\n",
      "himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\n",
      "to dance with.\n",
      "He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\n",
      "with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\n",
      "drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\n",
      "assembled.\n",
      "“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\n",
      "conversation with Colonel Forster?”\n",
      "“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\n",
      "“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\n",
      "what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\n",
      "being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\n",
      "On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\n",
      "any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\n",
      "a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\n",
      "turned to him and said,--\n",
      "“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\n",
      "just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\n",
      "Meryton?”\n",
      "“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\n",
      "energetic.”\n",
      "“You are severe on us.”\n",
      "“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\n",
      "to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\n",
      "“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\n",
      "to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\n",
      "musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\n",
      "really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\n",
      "hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\n",
      "she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\n",
      "at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\n",
      "of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\n",
      "I shall keep mine to swell my song.”\n",
      "Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\n",
      "or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\n",
      "would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\n",
      "sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\n",
      "the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\n",
      "impatient for display.\n",
      "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\n",
      "application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\n",
      "manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\n",
      "had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\n",
      "much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\n",
      "end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n",
      "Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\n",
      "some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\n",
      "dancing at one end of the room.\n",
      "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\n",
      "passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\n",
      "much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\n",
      "was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\n",
      "“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\n",
      "nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\n",
      "refinements of polished societies.”\n",
      "“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\n",
      "the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\n",
      "Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\n",
      "continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\n",
      "not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\n",
      "“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\n",
      "you often dance at St. James’s?”\n",
      "“Never, sir.”\n",
      "“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\n",
      "“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\n",
      "“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy bowed.\n",
      "“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\n",
      "superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\n",
      "London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\n",
      "He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\n",
      "make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\n",
      "struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\n",
      "her,--\n",
      "“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\n",
      "me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\n",
      "cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\n",
      "And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\n",
      "extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\n",
      "drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\n",
      "“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\n",
      "not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\n",
      "her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\n",
      "all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n",
      "“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\n",
      "the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\n",
      "amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\n",
      "for one half hour.”\n",
      "“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\n",
      "“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\n",
      "cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\n",
      "partner?”\n",
      "Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\n",
      "her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\n",
      "complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\n",
      "“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\n",
      "“I should imagine not.”\n",
      "“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\n",
      "evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\n",
      "your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\n",
      "noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\n",
      "people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\n",
      "“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\n",
      "agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\n",
      "which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\n",
      "Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\n",
      "would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\n",
      "Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\n",
      "“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\n",
      "“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\n",
      "How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\n",
      "joy?”\n",
      "“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\n",
      "imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\n",
      "to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\n",
      "“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\n",
      "absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\n",
      "of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\n",
      "He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\n",
      "entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\n",
      "that all was safe, her wit flowed along.\n",
      "CHAPTER VII.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\n",
      "thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\n",
      "in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\n",
      "fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\n",
      "the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\n",
      "had left her four thousand pounds.\n",
      "She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\n",
      "father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\n",
      "London in a respectable line of trade.\n",
      "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\n",
      "convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\n",
      "thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\n",
      "to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\n",
      "their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\n",
      "better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\n",
      "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\n",
      "news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\n",
      "some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\n",
      "with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\n",
      "the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\n",
      "the head-quarters.\n",
      "Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\n",
      "intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\n",
      "officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\n",
      "and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\n",
      "visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\n",
      "unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\n",
      "Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\n",
      "mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\n",
      "an ensign.\n",
      "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\n",
      "Bennet coolly observed,--\n",
      "“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\n",
      "of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\n",
      "I am now convinced.”\n",
      "Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\n",
      "indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\n",
      "her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\n",
      "next morning to London.\n",
      "“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\n",
      "ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\n",
      "of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\n",
      "“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\n",
      "“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\n",
      "“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\n",
      "had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\n",
      "so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\n",
      "foolish.”\n",
      "“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\n",
      "their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\n",
      "not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\n",
      "liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\n",
      "heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\n",
      "should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\n",
      "Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\n",
      "his regimentals.”\n",
      "“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\n",
      "Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\n",
      "came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\n",
      "note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\n",
      "for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\n",
      "eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\n",
      "“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\n",
      "Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\n",
      "“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n",
      "     /* NIND “My dear friend, */\n",
      "     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\n",
      "     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n",
      "     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\n",
      "     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\n",
      "     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\n",
      "     Yours ever,\n",
      "“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”\n",
      "“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\n",
      "_that_.”\n",
      "“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”\n",
      "“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\n",
      "“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\n",
      "rain; and then you must stay all night.”\n",
      "“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\n",
      "they would not offer to send her home.”\n",
      "“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\n",
      "and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\n",
      "“I had much rather go in the coach.”\n",
      "“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\n",
      "wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\n",
      "“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\n",
      "“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\n",
      "will be answered.”\n",
      "She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\n",
      "were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\n",
      "mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\n",
      "day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\n",
      "rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\n",
      "delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\n",
      "Jane certainly could not come back.\n",
      "“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\n",
      "once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\n",
      "morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\n",
      "contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\n",
      "brought the following note for Elizabeth:--\n",
      "     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\n",
      "     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n",
      "     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\n",
      "     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\n",
      "     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\n",
      "     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\n",
      "     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\n",
      "“Yours, etc.”\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\n",
      "aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\n",
      "should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\n",
      "Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\n",
      "“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\n",
      "trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\n",
      "there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\n",
      "carriage.”\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\n",
      "carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\n",
      "her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n",
      "“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\n",
      "thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\n",
      "there.”\n",
      "“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\n",
      "“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\n",
      "horses?”\n",
      "“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\n",
      "when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\n",
      "“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\n",
      "impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\n",
      "exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\n",
      "“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\n",
      "Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\n",
      "together.\n",
      "“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\n",
      "see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\n",
      "In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\n",
      "of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\n",
      "field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\n",
      "over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\n",
      "within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\n",
      "glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n",
      "She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\n",
      "assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\n",
      "That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\n",
      "dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\n",
      "Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\n",
      "for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\n",
      "brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\n",
      "good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\n",
      "nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\n",
      "brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\n",
      "the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\n",
      "thinking only of his breakfast.\n",
      "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\n",
      "Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\n",
      "enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\n",
      "immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\n",
      "alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\n",
      "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\n",
      "however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\n",
      "could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\n",
      "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\n",
      "her.\n",
      "When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\n",
      "began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\n",
      "solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\n",
      "examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\n",
      "violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\n",
      "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n",
      "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\n",
      "ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\n",
      "the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\n",
      "nothing to do elsewhere.\n",
      "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\n",
      "unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\n",
      "wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\n",
      "at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\n",
      "of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\n",
      "present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\n",
      "despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\n",
      "back a supply of clothes.\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\n",
      "Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\n",
      "poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\n",
      "much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\n",
      "favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\n",
      "this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\n",
      "shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\n",
      "being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\n",
      "indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\n",
      "Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\n",
      "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\n",
      "regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\n",
      "attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\n",
      "herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\n",
      "others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\n",
      "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\n",
      "Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\n",
      "eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\n",
      "dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n",
      "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\n",
      "began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\n",
      "pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\n",
      "she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\n",
      "thought the same, and added,--\n",
      "“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\n",
      "walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\n",
      "looked almost wild.”\n",
      "“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\n",
      "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\n",
      "country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\n",
      "“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\n",
      "in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\n",
      "hide it not doing its office.”\n",
      "“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\n",
      "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\n",
      "when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\n",
      "escaped my notice.”\n",
      "“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\n",
      "inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\n",
      "an exhibition.”\n",
      "“Certainly not.”\n",
      "“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\n",
      "above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\n",
      "it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\n",
      "a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n",
      "“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\n",
      "Bingley.\n",
      "“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n",
      "“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\n",
      "eyes.”\n",
      "“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\n",
      "short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\n",
      "“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\n",
      "girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\n",
      "a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\n",
      "chance of it.”\n",
      "“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\n",
      "Meryton?”\n",
      "“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\n",
      "“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\n",
      "“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\n",
      "would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\n",
      "“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\n",
      "consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\n",
      "hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\n",
      "their dear friend’s vulgar relations.\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\n",
      "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\n",
      "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\n",
      "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\n",
      "when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\n",
      "down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\n",
      "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\n",
      "them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\n",
      "excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\n",
      "below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n",
      "“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\n",
      "reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\n",
      "“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\n",
      "am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\n",
      "“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\n",
      "I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\n",
      "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\n",
      "where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\n",
      "others; all that his library afforded.\n",
      "“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\n",
      "credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\n",
      "than I ever looked into.”\n",
      "Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\n",
      "in the room.\n",
      "“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\n",
      "so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\n",
      "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\n",
      "“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\n",
      "generations.”\n",
      "“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\n",
      "books.”\n",
      "“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\n",
      "these.”\n",
      "“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\n",
      "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\n",
      "half as delightful as Pemberley.”\n",
      "“I wish it may.”\n",
      "“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\n",
      "neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\n",
      "finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\n",
      "“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\n",
      "“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\n",
      "“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\n",
      "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\n",
      "attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\n",
      "the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\n",
      "sister, to observe the game.\n",
      "“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\n",
      "she be as tall as I am?”\n",
      "“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\n",
      "rather taller.”\n",
      "“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\n",
      "so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\n",
      "for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\n",
      "“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\n",
      "to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\n",
      "“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\n",
      "“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\n",
      "net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\n",
      "sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\n",
      "being informed that she was very accomplished.”\n",
      "“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\n",
      "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\n",
      "otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\n",
      "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\n",
      "cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\n",
      "acquaintance that are really accomplished.”\n",
      "“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\n",
      "“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\n",
      "idea of an accomplished woman.”\n",
      "“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\n",
      "“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\n",
      "esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\n",
      "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\n",
      "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\n",
      "this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\n",
      "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\n",
      "will be but half deserved.”\n",
      "“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\n",
      "something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\n",
      "reading.”\n",
      "“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\n",
      "I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\n",
      "“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\n",
      "this?”\n",
      "“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\n",
      "application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\n",
      "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\n",
      "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\n",
      "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\n",
      "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\n",
      "one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\n",
      "sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\n",
      "succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\n",
      "“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n",
      "“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\n",
      "to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\n",
      "despicable.”\n",
      "Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\n",
      "continue the subject.\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\n",
      "that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\n",
      "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\n",
      "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\n",
      "eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\n",
      "unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\n",
      "that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\n",
      "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\n",
      "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\n",
      "however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\n",
      "his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\n",
      "possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n",
      "CHAPTER IX.\n",
      "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\n",
      "morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\n",
      "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\n",
      "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\n",
      "sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\n",
      "note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\n",
      "own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\n",
      "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\n",
      "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n",
      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\n",
      "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\n",
      "not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\n",
      "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\n",
      "would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\n",
      "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\n",
      "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\n",
      "Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\n",
      "attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\n",
      "that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n",
      "“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\n",
      "moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\n",
      "a little longer on your kindness.”\n",
      "“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\n",
      "sure, will not hear of her removal.”\n",
      "“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n",
      "“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\n",
      "remains with us.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n",
      "“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\n",
      "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\n",
      "vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\n",
      "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\n",
      "temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\n",
      "_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\n",
      "over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\n",
      "equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\n",
      "hope, though you have but a short lease.”\n",
      "“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\n",
      "should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\n",
      "minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\n",
      "“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\n",
      "“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”\n",
      "“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\n",
      "through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”\n",
      "“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\n",
      "intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\n",
      "“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\n",
      "the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\n",
      "“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\n",
      "a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\n",
      "“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\n",
      "least that advantage.”\n",
      "“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\n",
      "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\n",
      "unvarying society.”\n",
      "“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\n",
      "observed in them for ever.”\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\n",
      "country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\n",
      "going on in the country as in town.”\n",
      "Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\n",
      "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\n",
      "victory over him, continued her triumph,--\n",
      "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\n",
      "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\n",
      "pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\n",
      "“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\n",
      "when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\n",
      "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\n",
      "“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\n",
      "gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\n",
      "at all.”\n",
      "“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\n",
      "mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\n",
      "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\n",
      "you must acknowledge to be true.”\n",
      "“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\n",
      "many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\n",
      "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\n",
      "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\n",
      "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\n",
      "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\n",
      "saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\n",
      "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\n",
      "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\n",
      "William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\n",
      "genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\n",
      "is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\n",
      "important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”\n",
      "“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\n",
      "“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\n",
      "my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\n",
      "work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\n",
      "judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\n",
      "assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\n",
      "Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”\n",
      "“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\n",
      "“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\n",
      "has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\n",
      "of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\n",
      "better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\n",
      "partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\n",
      "brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my\n",
      "sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\n",
      "But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\n",
      "wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\n",
      "“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\n",
      "been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\n",
      "discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\n",
      "“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.\n",
      "“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\n",
      "strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\n",
      "am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\n",
      "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\n",
      "tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\n",
      "speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\n",
      "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\n",
      "unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\n",
      "civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\n",
      "indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\n",
      "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\n",
      "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\n",
      "each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\n",
      "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\n",
      "into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n",
      "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\n",
      "and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\n",
      "affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\n",
      "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\n",
      "attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\n",
      "own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\n",
      "very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\n",
      "ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\n",
      "the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\n",
      "to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\n",
      "“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\n",
      "your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\n",
      "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”\n",
      "Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\n",
      "wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\n",
      "would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\n",
      "added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\n",
      "Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\n",
      "instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\n",
      "remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\n",
      "could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\n",
      "all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\n",
      "CHAPTER X.\n",
      "The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\n",
      "Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\n",
      "continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\n",
      "their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\n",
      "Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\n",
      "the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\n",
      "messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n",
      "Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\n",
      "attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\n",
      "commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\n",
      "of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\n",
      "with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\n",
      "exactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n",
      "“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\n",
      "He made no answer.\n",
      "“You write uncommonly fast.”\n",
      "“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\n",
      "“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\n",
      "year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”\n",
      "“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”\n",
      "“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\n",
      "“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\n",
      "“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\n",
      "pens remarkably well.”\n",
      "“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”\n",
      "“How can you contrive to write so even?”\n",
      "He was silent.\n",
      "“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\n",
      "and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\n",
      "little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\n",
      "Grantley’s.”\n",
      "“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\n",
      "present I have not room to do them justice.”\n",
      "“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\n",
      "always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\n",
      "to determine.”\n",
      "“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\n",
      "ease cannot write ill.”\n",
      "“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\n",
      "brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much\n",
      "for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\n",
      "“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\n",
      "“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way\n",
      "imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\n",
      "“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\n",
      "means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”\n",
      "“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”\n",
      "“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\n",
      "humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\n",
      "indirect boast.”\n",
      "“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”\n",
      "“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\n",
      "writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\n",
      "thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\n",
      "think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\n",
      "quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\n",
      "attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\n",
      "you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\n",
      "panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\n",
      "laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\n",
      "undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\n",
      "“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\n",
      "foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\n",
      "believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\n",
      "moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\n",
      "precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”\n",
      "“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\n",
      "would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\n",
      "dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\n",
      "mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay\n",
      "till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not\n",
      "go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”\n",
      "“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did\n",
      "not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\n",
      "more than he did himself.”\n",
      "“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my\n",
      "friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\n",
      "afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\n",
      "intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\n",
      "circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\n",
      "could.”\n",
      "“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\n",
      "as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\n",
      "“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for\n",
      "himself.”\n",
      "“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\n",
      "but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\n",
      "stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\n",
      "that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\n",
      "the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\n",
      "one argument in favour of its propriety.”\n",
      "“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\n",
      "with you.”\n",
      "“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\n",
      "either.”\n",
      "“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\n",
      "friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\n",
      "one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\n",
      "one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\n",
      "supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n",
      "circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\n",
      "thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\n",
      "where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\n",
      "very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\n",
      "with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\n",
      "“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\n",
      "with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\n",
      "appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\n",
      "between the parties?”\n",
      "“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\n",
      "forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\n",
      "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\n",
      "you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\n",
      "myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\n",
      "know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\n",
      "particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\n",
      "when he has nothing to do.”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\n",
      "rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\n",
      "resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\n",
      "brother for talking such nonsense.\n",
      "“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\n",
      "and want to silence this.”\n",
      "“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\n",
      "Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\n",
      "thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\n",
      "“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\n",
      "Darcy had much better finish his letter.”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n",
      "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\n",
      "for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\n",
      "the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\n",
      "way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\n",
      "seated herself.\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\n",
      "Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\n",
      "that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\n",
      "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n",
      "admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\n",
      "he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\n",
      "at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\n",
      "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\n",
      "any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\n",
      "him too little to care for his approbation.\n",
      "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\n",
      "lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\n",
      "Elizabeth, said to her,--\n",
      "“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\n",
      "opportunity of dancing a reel?”\n",
      "She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\n",
      "surprise at her silence.\n",
      "“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\n",
      "determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\n",
      "that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\n",
      "delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\n",
      "their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\n",
      "you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\n",
      "dare.”\n",
      "“Indeed I do not dare.”\n",
      "Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\n",
      "gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\n",
      "manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\n",
      "never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\n",
      "believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\n",
      "should be in some danger.\n",
      "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great\n",
      "anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\n",
      "assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\n",
      "She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\n",
      "their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\n",
      "“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\n",
      "next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\n",
      "desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\n",
      "and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after\n",
      "the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\n",
      "check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\n",
      "which your lady possesses.”\n",
      "“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\n",
      "“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed\n",
      "in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\n",
      "judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\n",
      "lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it\n",
      "taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”\n",
      "“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their\n",
      "colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\n",
      "copied.”\n",
      "At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\n",
      "Elizabeth herself.\n",
      "“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some\n",
      "confusion, lest they had been overheard.\n",
      "“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without\n",
      "telling us that you were coming out.”\n",
      "Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\n",
      "by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\n",
      "and immediately said,--\n",
      "“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\n",
      "avenue.”\n",
      "But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\n",
      "laughingly answered,--\n",
      "“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to\n",
      "uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\n",
      "fourth. Good-bye.”\n",
      "She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of\n",
      "being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\n",
      "as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\n",
      "CHAPTER XI.\n",
      "When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\n",
      "seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\n",
      "where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\n",
      "pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\n",
      "during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\n",
      "of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\n",
      "with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\n",
      "acquaintance with spirit.\n",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\n",
      "something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\n",
      "himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\n",
      "also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\n",
      "and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\n",
      "attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\n",
      "should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\n",
      "to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\n",
      "door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\n",
      "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\n",
      "card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\n",
      "Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\n",
      "petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\n",
      "silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\n",
      "Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\n",
      "sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\n",
      "and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\n",
      "rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\n",
      "Bennet.\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\n",
      "Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\n",
      "perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\n",
      "could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\n",
      "question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\n",
      "amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\n",
      "second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\n",
      "is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\n",
      "enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\n",
      "book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\n",
      "an excellent library.”\n",
      "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\n",
      "cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\n",
      "her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\n",
      "towards him and said,--\n",
      "“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\n",
      "Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\n",
      "the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\n",
      "some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\n",
      "pleasure.”\n",
      "“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\n",
      "chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\n",
      "thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\n",
      "round my cards.”\n",
      "“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\n",
      "carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\n",
      "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\n",
      "more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\n",
      "near so much like a ball.”\n",
      "Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\n",
      "the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\n",
      "whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\n",
      "desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\n",
      "turning to Elizabeth, said,--\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\n",
      "turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\n",
      "long in one attitude.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\n",
      "succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\n",
      "up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\n",
      "Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\n",
      "directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\n",
      "he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\n",
      "the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\n",
      "interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\n",
      "meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\n",
      "“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\n",
      "severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\n",
      "nothing about it.”\n",
      "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\n",
      "anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\n",
      "two motives.\n",
      "“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\n",
      "as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\n",
      "the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\n",
      "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\n",
      "appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\n",
      "completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\n",
      "as I sit by the fire.”\n",
      "“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\n",
      "abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\n",
      "“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\n",
      "can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\n",
      "as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\n",
      "“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\n",
      "yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\n",
      "no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\n",
      "ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\n",
      "Darcy may hug himself.”\n",
      "“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\n",
      "uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\n",
      "be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\n",
      "laugh.”\n",
      "“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\n",
      "wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\n",
      "be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\n",
      "joke.”\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\n",
      "not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\n",
      "and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\n",
      "laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\n",
      "you are without.”\n",
      "“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\n",
      "my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\n",
      "understanding to ridicule.”\n",
      "“Such as vanity and pride.”\n",
      "“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\n",
      "superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”\n",
      "Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n",
      "“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\n",
      "“and pray what is the result?”\n",
      "“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\n",
      "himself without disguise.”\n",
      "“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\n",
      "but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\n",
      "for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\n",
      "convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\n",
      "others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\n",
      "feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\n",
      "would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\n",
      "ever.”\n",
      "“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\n",
      "_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\n",
      "really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\n",
      "“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\n",
      "evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\n",
      "“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\n",
      "“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\n",
      "conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\n",
      "waking Mr. Hurst.”\n",
      "Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\n",
      "opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\n",
      "it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\n",
      "CHAPTER XII.\n",
      "In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\n",
      "next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\n",
      "them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\n",
      "her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\n",
      "would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive\n",
      "them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\n",
      "least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\n",
      "before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\n",
      "and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\n",
      "well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\n",
      "resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\n",
      "contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\n",
      "she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\n",
      "length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\n",
      "that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\n",
      "The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\n",
      "said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\n",
      "Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\n",
      "then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\n",
      "of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\n",
      "The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\n",
      "soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\n",
      "safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\n",
      "she felt herself to be right.\n",
      "To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\n",
      "Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\n",
      "Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\n",
      "wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\n",
      "should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\n",
      "influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\n",
      "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\n",
      "in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\n",
      "ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\n",
      "one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\n",
      "conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\n",
      "On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\n",
      "all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\n",
      "very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\n",
      "after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\n",
      "see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\n",
      "tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\n",
      "the whole party in the liveliest spirits.\n",
      "They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\n",
      "wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\n",
      "trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\n",
      "father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\n",
      "glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\n",
      "evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\n",
      "animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\n",
      "Elizabeth.\n",
      "They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human\n",
      "nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of\n",
      "threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\n",
      "for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said\n",
      "in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\n",
      "had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it\n",
      "had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIII\n",
      "“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\n",
      "breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\n",
      "because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”\n",
      "“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\n",
      "unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners\n",
      "are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”\n",
      "“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\n",
      "Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly\n",
      "thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.\n",
      "But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got\n",
      "to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this\n",
      "moment.”\n",
      "“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I\n",
      "never saw in the whole course of my life.”\n",
      "This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\n",
      "eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\n",
      "After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\n",
      "explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a\n",
      "fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,\n",
      "and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\n",
      "when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\n",
      "pleases.”\n",
      "“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\n",
      "Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\n",
      "in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\n",
      "children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\n",
      "to do something or other about it.”\n",
      "Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\n",
      "They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\n",
      "bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\n",
      "five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\n",
      "“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and\n",
      "nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\n",
      "But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little\n",
      "softened by his manner of expressing himself.”\n",
      "“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of\n",
      "him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\n",
      "friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\n",
      "did before him?”\n",
      "“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\n",

      "doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This\n",
      "gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--\n",
      "“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\n",
      "prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\n",
      "oddly.”\n",
      "“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\n",
      "“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\n",
      "must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,\n",
      "I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\n",
      "will go when once they come to be entailed.”\n",
      "“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\n",
      "could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\n",
      "forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\n",
      "prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,\n",
      "when we are better acquainted----”\n",
      "He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\n",
      "other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The\n",
      "hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\n",
      "and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s\n",
      "heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\n",
      "own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\n",
      "and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\n",
      "cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\n",
      "him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\n",
      "cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\n",
      "pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\n",
      "herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a\n",
      "quarter of an hour.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\n",
      "were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\n",
      "guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\n",
      "shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\n",
      "Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\n",
      "comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\n",
      "better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\n",
      "to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\n",
      "he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\n",
      "person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\n",
      "experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\n",
      "approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\n",
      "preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\n",
      "and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\n",
      "quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\n",
      "people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\n",
      "She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\n",
      "made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\n",
      "neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\n",
      "two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\n",
      "marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\n",
      "once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\n",
      "approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\n",
      "to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.\n",
      "“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\n",
      "dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\n",
      "in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”\n",
      "“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\n",
      "from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”\n",
      "“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”\n",
      "“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\n",
      "extensive property.”\n",
      "“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\n",
      "many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”\n",
      "“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\n",
      "that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\n",
      "handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\n",
      "the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\n",
      "constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\n",
      "accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\n",
      "informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\n",
      "resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\n",
      "to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\n",
      "“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\n",
      "court.”\n",
      "“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\n",
      "and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\n",
      "the British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\n",
      "with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\n",
      "offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\n",
      "ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\n",
      "charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\n",
      "elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\n",
      "her. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\n",
      "it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\n",
      "pay.”\n",
      "“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you\n",
      "that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\n",
      "whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\n",
      "moment, or are the result of previous study?”\n",
      "“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\n",
      "sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\n",
      "compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\n",
      "give them as unstudied an air as possible.”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\n",
      "as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\n",
      "maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\n",
      "and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\n",
      "in his pleasure.\n",
      "By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\n",
      "to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,\n",
      "glad to invite him\n",
      "to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\n",
      "was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be\n",
      "from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,\n",
      "protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\n",
      "exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\n",
      "chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and\n",
      "before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\n",
      "interrupted him with,--\n",
      "“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away\n",
      "Richard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\n",
      "so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\n",
      "about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”\n",
      "Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\n",
      "Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--\n",
      "“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\n",
      "of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\n",
      "me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\n",
      "them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”\n",
      "Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\n",
      "backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\n",
      "very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\n",
      "interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\n",
      "resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\n",
      "young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\n",
      "affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\n",
      "for backgammon.\n",
      "CHAPTER XV.\n",
      "Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\n",
      "been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\n",
      "his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\n",
      "miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\n",
      "had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful\n",
      "acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\n",
      "given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good\n",
      "deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\n",
      "retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\n",
      "prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\n",
      "Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\n",
      "felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\n",
      "mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\n",
      "clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\n",
      "pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n",
      "Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\n",
      "marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\n",
      "a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\n",
      "them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\n",
      "This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s\n",
      "estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\n",
      "suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\n",
      "part.\n",
      "His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\n",
      "confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\n",
      "was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\n",
      "choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\n",
      "of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\n",
      "conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\n",
      "to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\n",
      "Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\n",
      "encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to\n",
      "her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\n",
      "not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\n",
      "_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to\n",
      "hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”\n",
      "Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\n",
      "done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\n",
      "next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\n",
      "two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\n",
      "the day before, was now high in her good graces.\n",
      "Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\n",
      "except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\n",
      "at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\n",
      "and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\n",
      "him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\n",
      "one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\n",
      "Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\n",
      "doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\n",
      "always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\n",
      "Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\n",
      "house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\n",
      "was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\n",
      "walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\n",
      "than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\n",
      "go.\n",
      "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\n",
      "cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\n",
      "the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\n",
      "were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\n",
      "nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\n",
      "a shop window, could recall them.\n",
      "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\n",
      "they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\n",
      "with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\n",
      "Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\n",
      "he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\n",
      "wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\n",
      "to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\n",
      "something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\n",
      "pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\n",
      "spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\n",
      "introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\n",
      "before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\n",
      "their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\n",
      "only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\n",
      "greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\n",
      "countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\n",
      "was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\n",
      "readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\n",
      "whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\n",
      "when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\n",
      "seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\n",
      "the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\n",
      "civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\n",
      "principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\n",
      "purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\n",
      "was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\n",
      "were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\n",
      "happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\n",
      "was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\n",
      "one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\n",
      "touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\n",
      "What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\n",
      "impossible not to long to know.\n",
      "In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\n",
      "passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n",
      "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\n",
      "Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\n",
      "pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\n",
      "Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\n",
      "invitation.\n",
      "Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\n",
      "their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\n",
      "expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\n",
      "carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\n",
      "she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\n",
      "told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\n",
      "because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\n",
      "towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\n",
      "her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\n",
      "apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\n",
      "her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\n",
      "justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\n",
      "her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\n",
      "breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\n",
      "by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\n",
      "could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\n",
      "brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\n",
      "commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\n",
      "she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\n",
      "appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\n",
      "but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\n",
      "officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\n",
      "disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\n",
      "next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\n",
      "Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\n",
      "would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\n",
      "protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\n",
      "tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\n",
      "delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\n",
      "Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\n",
      "with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.\n",
      "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\n",
      "between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\n",
      "both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\n",
      "behaviour than her sister.\n",
      "Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\n",
      "Philips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\n",
      "Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\n",
      "she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\n",
      "pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\n",
      "utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\n",
      "attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\n",
      "much attention in the whole course of his life.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVI.\n",
      "As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\n",
      "aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\n",
      "a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\n",
      "conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\n",
      "girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\n",
      "that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\n",
      "the house.\n",
      "When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\n",
      "Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\n",
      "struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\n",
      "might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\n",
      "at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\n",
      "gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\n",
      "was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\n",
      "description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\n",
      "that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\n",
      "the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\n",
      "with the housekeeper’s room.\n",
      "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\n",
      "with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\n",
      "improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\n",
      "gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\n",
      "listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\n",
      "heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\n",
      "soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\n",
      "and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\n",
      "their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\n",
      "interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\n",
      "The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\n",
      "of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\n",
      "officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\n",
      "gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\n",
      "Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\n",
      "walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\n",
      "breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\n",
      "turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\n",
      "himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\n",
      "conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\n",
      "probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\n",
      "dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\n",
      "skill of the speaker.\n",
      "With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\n",
      "officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\n",
      "ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\n",
      "listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\n",
      "supplied with coffee and muffin.\n",
      "When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\n",
      "in return, by sitting down to whist.\n",
      "“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\n",
      "improve myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\n",
      "thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\n",
      "received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\n",
      "seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\n",
      "determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\n",
      "she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\n",
      "and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\n",
      "Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\n",
      "at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\n",
      "though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\n",
      "the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\n",
      "mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\n",
      "relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\n",
      "Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\n",
      "a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n",
      "“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\n",
      "drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\n",
      "understand.”\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\n",
      "thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\n",
      "giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\n",
      "connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\n",
      "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\n",
      "seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\n",
      "yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\n",
      "four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\n",
      "disagreeable.”\n",
      "“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\n",
      "agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\n",
      "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\n",
      "be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\n",
      "astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\n",
      "anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\n",
      "“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\n",
      "Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\n",
      "him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\n",
      "“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\n",
      "interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\n",
      "their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\n",
      "world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\n",
      "high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\n",
      "“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\n",
      "ill-tempered man.”\n",
      "Wickham only shook his head.\n",
      "“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\n",
      "likely to be in this country much longer.”\n",
      "“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\n",
      "was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\n",
      "not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\n",
      "“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\n",
      "wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\n",
      "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\n",
      "avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\n",
      "very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\n",
      "His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\n",
      "that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\n",
      "in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\n",
      "thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\n",
      "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\n",
      "everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\n",
      "memory of his father.”\n",
      "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\n",
      "all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\n",
      "neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\n",
      "had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\n",
      "very intelligible gallantry.\n",
      "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\n",
      "“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\n",
      "most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\n",
      "further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\n",
      "attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\n",
      "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\n",
      "my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\n",
      "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\n",
      "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\n",
      "was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\n",
      "possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\n",
      "were speaking of just now.”\n",
      "“Indeed!”\n",
      "“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\n",
      "living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\n",
      "I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\n",
      "and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n",
      "elsewhere.”\n",
      "“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\n",
      "will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”\n",
      "“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\n",
      "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\n",
      "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\n",
      "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\n",
      "to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\n",
      "Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\n",
      "was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\n",
      "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\n",
      "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\n",
      "may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\n",
      "freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\n",
      "different sort of men, and that he hates me.”\n",
      "“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\n",
      "“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\n",
      "can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\n",
      "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\n",
      "ever as he expressed them.\n",
      "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\n",
      "have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\n",
      "“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\n",
      "attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\n",
      "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\n",
      "attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\n",
      "not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\n",
      "of preference which was often given me.”\n",
      "“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\n",
      "him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\n",
      "despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\n",
      "descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\n",
      "this!”\n",
      "After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\n",
      "remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\n",
      "his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\n",
      "must be dreadful.”\n",
      "“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\n",
      "hardly be just to him.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\n",
      "treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\n",
      "father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\n",
      "countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\n",
      "with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\n",
      "childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\n",
      "manner.”\n",
      "“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\n",
      "part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\n",
      "sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\n",
      "father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\n",
      "appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\n",
      "to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\n",
      "Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n",
      "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\n",
      "be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\n",
      "and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\n",
      "voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\n",
      "to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”\n",
      "“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\n",
      "pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\n",
      "motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\n",
      "dishonesty I must call it.”\n",
      "“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\n",
      "traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\n",
      "connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\n",
      "of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\n",
      "impulses even than pride.”\n",
      "“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\n",
      "“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\n",
      "freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\n",
      "poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\n",
      "father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\n",
      "degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\n",
      "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\n",
      "which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\n",
      "careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\n",
      "as the most attentive and best of brothers.”\n",
      "“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”\n",
      "He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\n",
      "speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\n",
      "proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\n",
      "of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\n",
      "nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\n",
      "and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\n",
      "home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\n",
      "education.”\n",
      "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\n",
      "help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\n",
      "“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\n",
      "who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\n",
      "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\n",
      "know Mr. Bingley?”\n",
      "“Not at all.”\n",
      "“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\n",
      "Darcy is.”\n",
      "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\n",
      "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\n",
      "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\n",
      "very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\n",
      "never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\n",
      "sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\n",
      "something for fortune and figure.”\n",
      "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\n",
      "the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\n",
      "Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\n",
      "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\n",
      "but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\n",
      "her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\n",
      "that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\n",
      "make herself uneasy.\n",
      "“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\n",
      "card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\n",
      "am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\n",
      "are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\n",
      "Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\n",
      "little matters.”\n",
      "Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\n",
      "a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\n",
      "were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.\n",
      "“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\n",
      "living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\n",
      "notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\n",
      "“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\n",
      "were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”\n",
      "“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\n",
      "connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\n",
      "yesterday.”\n",
      "“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\n",
      "believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\n",
      "This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\n",
      "Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\n",
      "affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\n",
      "self-destined to another.\n",
      "“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\n",
      "daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\n",
      "Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\n",
      "her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\n",
      "“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\n",
      "not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\n",
      "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\n",
      "reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\n",
      "she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\n",
      "her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\n",
      "chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\n",
      "the first class.”\n",
      "Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\n",
      "they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\n",
      "an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\n",
      "Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\n",
      "Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\n",
      "everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\n",
      "gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\n",
      "think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\n",
      "the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\n",
      "they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\n",
      "talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\n",
      "fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\n",
      "at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\n",
      "that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\n",
      "before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVII.\n",
      "Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.\n",
      "Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\n",
      "knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\n",
      "Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the\n",
      "veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\n",
      "possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\n",
      "interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\n",
      "done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\n",
      "throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\n",
      "otherwise explained.\n",
      "“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\n",
      "other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\n",
      "misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\n",
      "conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\n",
      "without actual blame on either side.”\n",
      "“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\n",
      "behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\n",
      "business? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\n",
      "somebody.”\n",
      "“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\n",
      "opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\n",
      "it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\n",
      "manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\n",
      "impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\n",
      "character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\n",
      "excessively deceived in him? Oh no.”\n",
      "“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\n",
      "Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\n",
      "night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\n",
      "so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”\n",
      "“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\n",
      "think.”\n",
      "“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”\n",
      "But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\n",
      "Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\n",
      "the affair became public.\n",
      "The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\n",
      "conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\n",
      "they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\n",
      "personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\n",
      "fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\n",
      "their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\n",
      "repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\n",
      "separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\n",
      "avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\n",
      "and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\n",
      "their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\n",
      "hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.\n",
      "The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\n",
      "female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\n",
      "compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\n",
      "receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\n",
      "ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\n",
      "society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\n",
      "Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\n",
      "Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\n",
      "and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\n",
      "less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\n",
      "each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\n",
      "he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\n",
      "was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\n",
      "had no disinclination for it.\n",
      "“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\n",
      "think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\n",
      "Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\n",
      "consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\n",
      "everybody.”\n",
      "Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\n",
      "not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\n",
      "him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\n",
      "did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\n",
      "amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\n",
      "scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\n",
      "either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\n",
      "dance.\n",
      "“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\n",
      "this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\n",
      "have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\n",
      "myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\n",
      "cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\n",
      "soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\n",
      "preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\n",
      "cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”\n",
      "Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\n",
      "engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\n",
      "instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\n",
      "for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\n",
      "delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\n",
      "good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\n",
      "gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\n",
      "struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\n",
      "being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\n",
      "quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\n",
      "The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\n",
      "civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\n",
      "compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\n",
      "gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\n",
      "her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\n",
      "was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\n",
      "to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\n",
      "consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\n",
      "till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n",
      "If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\n",
      "younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\n",
      "for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\n",
      "such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\n",
      "aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\n",
      "for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\n",
      "trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\n",
      "of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\n",
      "Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\n",
      "endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVIII.\n",
      "Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\n",
      "vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\n",
      "doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\n",
      "meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\n",
      "might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\n",
      "usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\n",
      "that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\n",
      "might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\n",
      "dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\n",
      "was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\n",
      "pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\n",
      "who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\n",
      "the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\n",
      "smile,--\n",
      "“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\n",
      "he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”\n",
      "This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\n",
      "Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\n",
      "Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\n",
      "of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\n",
      "disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\n",
      "the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\n",
      "Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\n",
      "was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\n",
      "with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\n",
      "speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\n",
      "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\n",
      "of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\n",
      "spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\n",
      "had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\n",
      "transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\n",
      "particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\n",
      "distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\n",
      "solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\n",
      "without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\n",
      "disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\n",
      "release from him was ecstasy.\n",
      "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\n",
      "Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\n",
      "were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\n",
      "her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\n",
      "her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\n",
      "knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\n",
      "immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\n",
      "mind: Charlotte tried to console her.\n",
      "“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\n",
      "“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\n",
      "a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\n",
      "evil.”\n",
      "When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\n",
      "hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\n",
      "simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\n",
      "in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\n",
      "answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\n",
      "she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\n",
      "reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\n",
      "They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\n",
      "imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\n",
      "first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\n",
      "would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\n",
      "she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\n",
      "silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\n",
      "with--\n",
      "“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\n",
      "dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\n",
      "room, or the number of couples.”\n",
      "He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\n",
      "said.\n",
      "“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\n",
      "may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\n",
      "_now_ we may be silent.”\n",
      "“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\n",
      "“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\n",
      "entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\n",
      "_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\n",
      "trouble of saying as little as possible.”\n",
      "“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\n",
      "imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\n",
      "“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\n",
      "similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\n",
      "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\n",
      "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\n",
      "posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\n",
      "“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\n",
      "said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\n",
      "think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\n",
      "“I must not decide on my own performance.”\n",
      "He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\n",
      "the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\n",
      "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\n",
      "the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\n",
      "been forming a new acquaintance.”\n",
      "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\n",
      "features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\n",
      "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\n",
      "constrained manner said,--\n",
      "“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\n",
      "_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\n",
      "is less certain.”\n",
      "“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\n",
      "with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\n",
      "his life.”\n",
      "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\n",
      "that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\n",
      "through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\n",
      "Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\n",
      "his dancing and his partner.\n",
      "“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\n",
      "superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\n",
      "first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\n",
      "disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\n",
      "especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\n",
      "at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\n",
      "then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\n",
      "You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\n",
      "that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\n",
      "The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\n",
      "William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\n",
      "eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\n",
      "Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\n",
      "he turned to his partner, and said,--\n",
      "“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\n",
      "of.”\n",
      "“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\n",
      "interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\n",
      "themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\n",
      "and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\n",
      "“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\n",
      "“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\n",
      "feelings.”\n",
      "“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\n",
      "no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\n",
      "“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\n",
      "something else.”\n",
      "“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\n",
      "with a look of doubt.\n",
      "“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\n",
      "thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\n",
      "by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\n",
      "unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\n",
      "created_?”\n",
      "“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\n",
      "“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\n",
      "“I hope not.”\n",
      "“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\n",
      "to be secure of judging properly at first.”\n",
      "“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\n",
      "“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\n",
      "to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\n",
      "“And what is your success?”\n",
      "She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\n",
      "accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\n",
      "“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\n",
      "greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\n",
      "not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\n",
      "fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\n",
      "“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\n",
      "opportunity.”\n",
      "“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\n",
      "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\n",
      "silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\n",
      "in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\n",
      "which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\n",
      "another.\n",
      "They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\n",
      "with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--\n",
      "“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\n",
      "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\n",
      "questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\n",
      "other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\n",
      "Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\n",
      "implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\n",
      "him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\n",
      "remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\n",
      "most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\n",
      "well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\n",
      "to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\n",
      "could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\n",
      "was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\n",
      "His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\n",
      "I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\n",
      "discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\n",
      "descent, one could not expect much better.”\n",
      "“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\n",
      "said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\n",
      "worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\n",
      "assure you, he informed me himself.”\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n",
      "“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\n",
      "“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\n",
      "you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\n",
      "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\n",
      "Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\n",
      "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\n",
      "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n",
      "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\n",
      "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\n",
      "for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\n",
      "way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\n",
      "“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\n",
      "sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\n",
      "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\n",
      "you may be sure of my pardon.”\n",
      "“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",
      "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\n",
      "history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\n",
      "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\n",
      "the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n",
      "received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\n",
      "sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\n",
      "afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "regard.”\n",
      "“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\n",
      "“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n",
      "“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",
      "perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\n",
      "“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\n",
      "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\n",
      "him _conditionally_ only.”\n",
      "“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\n",
      "“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\n",
      "Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\n",
      "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\n",
      "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\n",
      "both gentlemen as I did before.”\n",
      "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\n",
      "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\n",
      "delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\n",
      "Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\n",
      "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\n",
      "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\n",
      "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\n",
      "and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\n",
      "as to make a most important discovery.\n",
      "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\n",
      "in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\n",
      "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\n",
      "this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\n",
      "Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\n",
      "have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\n",
      "Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\n",
      "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\n",
      "and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\n",
      "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\n",
      "“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\n",
      "I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\n",
      "assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\n",
      "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\n",
      "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\n",
      "an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\n",
      "was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\n",
      "side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n",
      "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\n",
      "the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\n",
      "speaking, replied thus,--\n",
      "“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\n",
      "excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\n",
      "understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\n",
      "between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\n",
      "which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\n",
      "the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\n",
      "in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\n",
      "same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\n",
      "dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\n",
      "what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\n",
      "your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\n",
      "though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\n",
      "and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\n",
      "yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\n",
      "reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\n",
      "being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\n",
      "a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\n",
      "hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\n",
      "“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\n",
      "expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\n",
      "unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\n",
      "replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\n",
      "discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\n",
      "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\n",
      "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\n",
      "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n",
      "“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\n",
      "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\n",
      "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\n",
      "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\n",
      "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\n",
      "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\n",
      "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\n",
      "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\n",
      "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\n",
      "her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\n",
      "very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\n",
      "bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\n",
      "even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\n",
      "saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\n",
      "lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\n",
      "she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\n",
      "one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\n",
      "talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\n",
      "else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\n",
      "Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\n",
      "of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\n",
      "a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\n",
      "were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\n",
      "comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\n",
      "certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\n",
      "was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\n",
      "Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\n",
      "and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\n",
      "consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\n",
      "not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\n",
      "to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\n",
      "occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\n",
      "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\n",
      "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\n",
      "chance of it.\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\n",
      "words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\n",
      "whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\n",
      "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\n",
      "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n",
      "“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\n",
      "sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\n",
      "nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\n",
      "“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\n",
      "to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\n",
      "so doing.”\n",
      "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\n",
      "talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\n",
      "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\n",
      "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\n",
      "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\n",
      "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\n",
      "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\n",
      "steady gravity.\n",
      "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\n",
      "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\n",
      "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\n",
      "Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\n",
      "tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\n",
      "had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n",
      "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\n",
      "entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\n",
      "complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\n",
      "opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\n",
      "she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\n",
      "which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\n",
      "amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\n",
      "prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\n",
      "began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\n",
      "her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\n",
      "She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\n",
      "talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\n",
      "signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\n",
      "impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
      "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\n",
      "and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\n",
      "“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\n",
      "Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\n",
      "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\n",
      "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\n",
      "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
      "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\n",
      "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\n",
      "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\n",
      "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\n",
      "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\n",
      "music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\n",
      "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\n",
      "an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\n",
      "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\n",
      "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\n",
      "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\n",
      "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\n",
      "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\n",
      "everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\n",
      "cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\n",
      "should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\n",
      "connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\n",
      "his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\n",
      "room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\n",
      "Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\n",
      "having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\n",
      "Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\n",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\n",
      "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\n",
      "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\n",
      "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\n",
      "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\n",
      "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\n",
      "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",
      "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\n",
      "she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\n",
      "the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\n",
      "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\n",
      "could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\n",
      "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\n",
      "somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\n",
      "room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\n",
      "to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\n",
      "himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\n",
      "close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\n",
      "project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\n",
      "often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\n",
      "to herself.\n",
      "She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\n",
      "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\n",
      "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\n",
      "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\n",
      "it.\n",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\n",
      "manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\n",
      "hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\n",
      "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\n",
      "sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\n",
      "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\n",
      "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\n",
      "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\n",
      "speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\n",
      "sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\n",
      "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\n",
      "nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\n",
      "rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\n",
      "silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\n",
      "much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\n",
      "how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\n",
      "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\n",
      "civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\n",
      "addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\n",
      "he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\n",
      "without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\n",
      "pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\n",
      "waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\n",
      "go the next day for a short time.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\n",
      "delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\n",
      "settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\n",
      "see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\n",
      "months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\n",
      "with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\n",
      "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\n",
      "man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\n",
      "was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIX.\n",
      "The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\n",
      "declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\n",
      "his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\n",
      "no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\n",
      "moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\n",
      "observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\n",
      "after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--\n",
      "“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\n",
      "when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\n",
      "course of this morning?”\n",
      "Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet instantly answered,--\n",
      "“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\n",
      "she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\n",
      "gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\n",
      "called out,--\n",
      "“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\n",
      "me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\n",
      "going away myself.”\n",
      "“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\n",
      "upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\n",
      "to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\n",
      "Mr. Collins.”\n",
      "Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\n",
      "consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\n",
      "over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\n",
      "to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\n",
      "between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\n",
      "soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\n",
      "doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\n",
      "would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\n",
      "unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\n",
      "mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\n",
      "of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\n",
      "dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\n",
      "soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\n",
      "future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\n",
      "subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\n",
      "marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\n",
      "of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\n",
      "The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\n",
      "with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\n",
      "use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\n",
      "he continued,--\n",
      "“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\n",
      "every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\n",
      "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\n",
      "very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\n",
      "have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\n",
      "recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\n",
      "patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\n",
      "too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\n",
      "left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\n",
      "arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\n",
      "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\n",
      "gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\n",
      "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\n",
      "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\n",
      "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\n",
      "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\n",
      "kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\n",
      "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\n",
      "anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\n",
      "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\n",
      "which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n",
      "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\n",
      "were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\n",
      "assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\n",
      "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\n",
      "father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\n",
      "myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\n",
      "the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\n",
      "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\n",
      "for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\n",
      "flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\n",
      "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\n",
      "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\n",
      "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\n",
      "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\n",
      "in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\n",
      "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\n",
      "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\n",
      "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\n",
      "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n",
      "“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\n",
      "answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\n",
      "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\n",
      "your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n",
      "hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\n",
      "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\n",
      "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\n",
      "third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\n",
      "just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\n",
      "“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\n",
      "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\n",
      "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\n",
      "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\n",
      "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\n",
      "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\n",
      "would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\n",
      "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\n",
      "situation.”\n",
      "“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\n",
      "very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\n",
      "disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\n",
      "seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\n",
      "economy, and other amiable qualifications.”\n",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\n",
      "give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\n",
      "believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\n",
      "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n",
      "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\n",
      "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\n",
      "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\n",
      "considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\n",
      "spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\n",
      "addressed her,--\n",
      "“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\n",
      "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\n",
      "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\n",
      "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\n",
      "first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\n",
      "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\n",
      "female character.”\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\n",
      "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\n",
      "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\n",
      "may convince you of its being one.”\n",
      "“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\n",
      "refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\n",
      "believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\n",
      "is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer\n",
      "would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my\n",
      "connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your\n",
      "own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\n",
      "further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\n",
      "by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\n",
      "Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo\n",
      "the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\n",
      "therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\n",
      "shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\n",
      "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\n",
      "“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\n",
      "of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\n",
      "rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\n",
      "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\n",
      "to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n",
      "forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\n",
      "female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\n",
      "truth from her heart.”\n",
      "“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\n",
      "gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\n",
      "authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\n",
      "being acceptable.”\n",
      "To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\n",
      "reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\n",
      "persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\n",
      "encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\n",
      "in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\n",
      "not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\n",
      "CHAPTER XX.\n",
      "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\n",
      "successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\n",
      "to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\n",
      "door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\n",
      "entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\n",
      "warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\n",
      "received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\n",
      "proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\n",
      "of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\n",
      "refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\n",
      "from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\n",
      "This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\n",
      "glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\n",
      "him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\n",
      "and could not help saying so.\n",
      "“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\n",
      "brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\n",
      "a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\n",
      "I will _make_ her know it.”\n",
      "“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she\n",
      "is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\n",
      "altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\n",
      "naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\n",
      "actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\n",
      "force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\n",
      "temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\n",
      "“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\n",
      "only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\n",
      "good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\n",
      "we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\n",
      "She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\n",
      "husband, called out, as she entered the library,--\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\n",
      "You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\n",
      "not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\n",
      "not have _her_.”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\n",
      "on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\n",
      "her communication.\n",
      "“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\n",
      "finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\n",
      "“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\n",
      "and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\n",
      "“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”\n",
      "“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\n",
      "marrying him.”\n",
      "“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\n",
      "library.\n",
      "“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for\n",
      "you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\n",
      "you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”\n",
      "Elizabeth replied that it was.\n",
      "“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\n",
      "“I have, sir.”\n",
      "“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\n",
      "accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\n",
      "“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\n",
      "“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\n",
      "be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\n",
      "again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\n",
      "if you _do_.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\n",
      "but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\n",
      "affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n",
      "“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\n",
      "to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\n",
      "“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\n",
      "First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\n",
      "present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\n",
      "library to myself as soon as may be.”\n",
      "Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\n",
      "coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\n",
      "her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\n",
      "interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\n",
      "sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\n",
      "varied, however, her determination never did.\n",
      "Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\n",
      "He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\n",
      "could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\n",
      "way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\n",
      "deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\n",
      "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\n",
      "the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\n",
      "her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\n",
      "fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\n",
      "made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\n",
      "Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,\n",
      "who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\n",
      "breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\n",
      "the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\n",
      "her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her\n",
      "family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;\n",
      "“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,\n",
      "nobody feels for my poor nerves.”\n",
      "Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\n",
      "“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as\n",
      "may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she\n",
      "can have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\n",
      "into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\n",
      "you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\n",
      "to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\n",
      "you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\n",
      "you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\n",
      "and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\n",
      "to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\n",
      "to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\n",
      "no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\n",
      "is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\n",
      "Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\n",
      "attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\n",
      "She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\n",
      "they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\n",
      "than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--\n",
      "“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\n",
      "let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”\n",
      "Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\n",
      "Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\n",
      "detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\n",
      "herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\n",
      "curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\n",
      "not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\n",
      "conversation:--\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Collins!”\n",
      "“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\n",
      "Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\n",
      "displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\n",
      "inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\n",
      "who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\n",
      "trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\n",
      "positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\n",
      "have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\n",
      "blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\n",
      "You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\n",
      "family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\n",
      "daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\n",
      "compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\n",
      "My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\n",
      "dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\n",
      "liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\n",
      "My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\n",
      "consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\n",
      "has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XXI.\n",
      "The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\n",
      "Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\n",
      "attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\n",
      "As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\n",
      "by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\n",
      "stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\n",
      "her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\n",
      "himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\n",
      "civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\n",
      "especially to her friend.\n",
      "The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\n",
      "health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\n",
      "had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\n",
      "not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\n",
      "Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.\n",
      "After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\n",
      "were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\n",
      "He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\n",
      "aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\n",
      "well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\n",
      "that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\n",
      "“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\n",
      "Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\n",
      "many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\n",
      "might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\n",
      "She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full\n",
      "discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly\n",
      "bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\n",
      "them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\n",
      "His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the\n",
      "compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an\n",
      "occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\n",
      "Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\n",
      "from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\n",
      "sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\n",
      "fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\n",
      "she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\n",
      "Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\n",
      "join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\n",
      "Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\n",
      "even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\n",
      "than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\n",
      "had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\n",
      "from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\n",
      "The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\n",
      "to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\n",
      "what she says.”\n",
      "She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\n",
      "of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\n",
      "and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\n",
      "Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\n",
      "regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\n",
      "dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\n",
      "returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\n",
      "meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\n",
      "unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\n",
      "high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\n",
      "distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\n",
      "saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\n",
      "absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\n",
      "to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\n",
      "cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.\n",
      "“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\n",
      "able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\n",
      "hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\n",
      "forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\n",
      "intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\n",
      "satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\n",
      "Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.\n",
      "“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\n",
      "took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\n",
      "are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\n",
      "Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\n",
      "determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\n",
      "his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\n",
      "already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\n",
      "friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\n",
      "despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\n",
      "the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\n",
      "will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\n",
      "whom we shall deprive you.’\n",
      "“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\n",
      "winter.”\n",
      "“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”\n",
      "“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\n",
      "But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\n",
      "particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\n",
      "impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\n",
      "less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\n",
      "her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\n",
      "she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\n",
      "more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\n",
      "hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\n",
      "you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\n",
      "without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\n",
      "unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\n",
      "frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\n",
      "relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\n",
      "partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\n",
      "capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\n",
      "favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\n",
      "Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\n",
      "of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\n",
      "Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\n",
      "declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\n",
      "that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\n",
      "if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\n",
      "kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\n",
      "subject?”\n",
      "“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”\n",
      "“Most willingly.”\n",
      "“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\n",
      "in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\n",
      "town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\n",
      "does not care about you.”\n",
      "Jane shook her head.\n",
      "“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\n",
      "together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\n",
      "is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\n",
      "Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\n",
      "case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\n",
      "is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\n",
      "that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\n",
      "in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\n",
      "dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\n",
      "dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\n",
      "tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n",
      "degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\n",
      "Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\n",
      "of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”\n",
      "“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\n",
      "representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\n",
      "foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\n",
      "anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\n",
      "herself.”\n",
      "“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\n",
      "will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\n",
      "You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\n",
      "“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\n",
      "accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\n",
      "elsewhere?”\n",
      "“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\n",
      "deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\n",
      "more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\n",
      "by all means, to refuse him.”\n",
      "“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\n",
      "though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\n",
      "not hesitate.”\n",
      "“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\n",
      "your situation with much compassion.”\n",
      "“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\n",
      "required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”\n",
      "The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\n",
      "contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\n",
      "interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\n",
      "wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\n",
      "so totally independent of everyone.\n",
      "She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\n",
      "the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\n",
      "Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\n",
      "though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\n",
      "Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.\n",
      "They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\n",
      "family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\n",
      "but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\n",
      "and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\n",
      "to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\n",
      "lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\n",
      "thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\n",
      "Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\n",
      "that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\n",
      "care to have two full courses.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXII.\n",
      "The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\n",
      "chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\n",
      "Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\n",
      "humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”\n",
      "Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\n",
      "that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\n",
      "very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\n",
      "had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\n",
      "from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\n",
      "herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\n",
      "favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\n",
      "sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\n",
      "But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\n",
      "character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\n",
      "morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n",
      "himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\n",
      "from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\n",
      "conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\n",
      "till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\n",
      "secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\n",
      "he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\n",
      "reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\n",
      "perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\n",
      "instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\n",
      "she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n",
      "In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\n",
      "everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\n",
      "they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\n",
      "was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\n",
      "be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\n",
      "his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\n",
      "guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\n",
      "continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\n",
      "disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\n",
      "establishment were gained.\n",
      "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\n",
      "and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\n",
      "circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\n",
      "they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\n",
      "exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n",
      "interest than the matter had ever\n",
      "excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\n",
      "Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\n",
      "should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\n",
      "expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\n",
      "James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\n",
      "occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\n",
      "sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\n",
      "from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\n",
      "herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\n",
      "to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\n",
      "Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\n",
      "irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\n",
      "be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\n",
      "marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\n",
      "provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\n",
      "uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\n",
      "from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\n",
      "twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\n",
      "luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\n",
      "surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\n",
      "valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\n",
      "probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\n",
      "shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\n",
      "to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\n",
      "when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\n",
      "passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\n",
      "dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\n",
      "curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\n",
      "questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\n",
      "at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\n",
      "publish his prosperous love.\n",
      "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\n",
      "the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\n",
      "moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\n",
      "cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\n",
      "whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\n",
      "“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\n",
      "gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\n",
      "may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\n",
      "possible.”\n",
      "They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\n",
      "so speedy a return, immediately said,--\n",
      "“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\n",
      "good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\n",
      "offending your patroness.”\n",
      "“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\n",
      "for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\n",
      "material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”\n",
      "“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\n",
      "displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\n",
      "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\n",
      "and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\n",
      "affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\n",
      "from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\n",
      "your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\n",
      "though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\n",
      "now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\n",
      "my cousin Elizabeth.”\n",
      "With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\n",
      "surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\n",
      "to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\n",
      "her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n",
      "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\n",
      "solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\n",
      "means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\n",
      "improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\n",
      "agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\n",
      "kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\n",
      "private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n",
      "The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\n",
      "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\n",
      "that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\n",
      "as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\n",
      "consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\n",
      "she could not help crying out,--\n",
      "“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\n",
      "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\n",
      "story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\n",
      "reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\n",
      "her composure, and calmly replied,--\n",
      "“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\n",
      "that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\n",
      "because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\n",
      "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\n",
      "for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\n",
      "prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\n",
      "wished her all imaginable happiness.\n",
      "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\n",
      "very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\n",
      "But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\n",
      "satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\n",
      "was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\n",
      "character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n",
      "chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\n",
      "entering the marriage state.”\n",
      "Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\n",
      "they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\n",
      "longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\n",
      "was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\n",
      "unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\n",
      "of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\n",
      "accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\n",
      "not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\n",
      "that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\n",
      "feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\n",
      "most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\n",
      "herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\n",
      "that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\n",
      "she had chosen.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIII.\n",
      "Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\n",
      "she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,\n",
      "when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\n",
      "announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\n",
      "and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\n",
      "houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\n",
      "but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\n",
      "politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always\n",
      "unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--\n",
      "“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\n",
      "that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\n",
      "Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\n",
      "without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\n",
      "him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\n",
      "truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\n",
      "most forbearing courtesy.\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\n",
      "a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\n",
      "mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\n",
      "endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\n",
      "by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\n",
      "was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\n",
      "happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\n",
      "of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\n",
      "Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\n",
      "found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\n",
      "the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\n",
      "had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\n",
      "together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\n",
      "inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\n",
      "Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\n",
      "she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\n",
      "points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\n",
      "console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\n",
      "resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\n",
      "scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\n",
      "or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\n",
      "could at all forgive their daughter.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\n",
      "as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\n",
      "it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\n",
      "been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\n",
      "more foolish than his daughter!\n",
      "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\n",
      "less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\n",
      "nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\n",
      "Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\n",
      "clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\n",
      "to spread at Meryton.\n",
      "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\n",
      "called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\n",
      "though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\n",
      "enough to drive happiness away.\n",
      "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\n",
      "mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\n",
      "real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\n",
      "disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\n",
      "sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\n",
      "never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\n",
      "Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\n",
      "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\n",
      "the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\n",
      "letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\n",
      "father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\n",
      "twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\n",
      "discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\n",
      "with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\n",
      "affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\n",
      "that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\n",
      "been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\n",
      "Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\n",
      "for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\n",
      "she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\n",
      "be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\n",
      "day for making him the happiest of men.\n",
      "Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\n",
      "pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\n",
      "complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\n",
      "to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\n",
      "and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\n",
      "while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\n",
      "most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\n",
      "gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\n",
      "absence.\n",
      "Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\n",
      "day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\n",
      "report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\n",
      "Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\n",
      "falsehood.\n",
      "Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\n",
      "his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\n",
      "was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\n",
      "dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\n",
      "frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\n",
      "and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\n",
      "Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\n",
      "the strength of his attachment.\n",
      "As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\n",
      "painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\n",
      "concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\n",
      "was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\n",
      "hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\n",
      "impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\n",
      "did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\n",
      "Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\n",
      "tranquillity.\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\n",
      "reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\n",
      "first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\n",
      "and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\n",
      "from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\n",
      "him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\n",
      "to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\n",
      "anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\n",
      "wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\n",
      "Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\n",
      "regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\n",
      "them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\n",
      "whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\n",
      "they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\n",
      "and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\n",
      "complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\n",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\n",
      "Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\n",
      "to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”\n",
      "“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\n",
      "better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”\n",
      "This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\n",
      "making any answer, she went on as before.\n",
      "“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\n",
      "not for the entail, I should not mind it.”\n",
      "“What should not you mind?”\n",
      "“I should not mind anything at all.”\n",
      "“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\n",
      "insensibility.”\n",
      "“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\n",
      "anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\n",
      "daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\n",
      "Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”\n",
      "“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIV.\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\n",
      "sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\n",
      "the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\n",
      "time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\n",
      "the country.\n",
      "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\n",
      "the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\n",
      "writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\n",
      "the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\n",
      "boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\n",
      "the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\n",
      "letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\n",
      "inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\n",
      "the latter with regard to new furniture.\n",
      "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\n",
      "heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\n",
      "for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\n",
      "assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\n",
      "credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\n",
      "had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\n",
      "could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\n",
      "of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\n",
      "of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\n",
      "the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\n",
      "the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\n",
      "whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\n",
      "she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\n",
      "which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\n",
      "could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\n",
      "really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\n",
      "whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\n",
      "escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\n",
      "him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\n",
      "situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\n",
      "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\n",
      "Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a\n",
      "longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\n",
      "not help saying,--\n",
      "“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no\n",
      "idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\n",
      "will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\n",
      "all be as we were before.”\n",
      "Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\n",
      "reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\n",
      "acquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\n",
      "nothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\n",
      "time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”\n",
      "With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\n",
      "that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\n",
      "has done no harm to anyone but myself.”\n",
      "“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness\n",
      "and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\n",
      "you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\n",
      "deserve.”\n",
      "Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\n",
      "the praise on her sister’s warm affection.\n",
      "“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\n",
      "world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\n",
      "to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\n",
      "afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\n",
      "privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\n",
      "whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\n",
      "of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\n",
      "my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\n",
      "little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\n",
      "or sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\n",
      "the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\n",
      "is unaccountable!”\n",
      "“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\n",
      "ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\n",
      "situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and\n",
      "Charlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\n",
      "large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\n",
      "ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\n",
      "regard and esteem for our cousin.”\n",
      "“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\n",
      "could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\n",
      "Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\n",
      "understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\n",
      "conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\n",
      "I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\n",
      "cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\n",
      "it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\n",
      "change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\n",
      "yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\n",
      "danger security for happiness.”\n",
      "“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied\n",
      "Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\n",
      "together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\n",
      "mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\n",
      "you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\n",
      "saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\n",
      "ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\n",
      "to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\n",
      "our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\n",
      "it does.”\n",
      "“And men take care that they should.”\n",
      "“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\n",
      "of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”\n",
      "“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”\n",
      "said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\n",
      "unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\n",
      "want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,\n",
      "will do the business.”\n",
      "“And do you impute it to either of those?”\n",
      "“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I\n",
      "think of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”\n",
      "“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\n",
      "“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\n",
      "“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\n",
      "only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\n",
      "secure it.”\n",
      "“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\n",
      "happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\n",
      "may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\n",
      "connections, and pride.”\n",
      "“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;\n",
      "“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\n",
      "known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\n",
      "her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\n",
      "they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think\n",
      "herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\n",
      "objectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\n",
      "part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\n",
      "affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\n",
      "unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\n",
      "mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\n",
      "what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\n",
      "in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s\n",
      "name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\n",
      "more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\n",
      "for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\n",
      "with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\n",
      "she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\n",
      "the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\n",
      "her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\n",
      "the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\n",
      "comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\n",
      "day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\n",
      "to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\n",
      "then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\n",
      "among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\n",
      "be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\n",
      "Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\n",
      "be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\n",
      "“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\n",
      "all expect Jane’s good fortune.”\n",
      "“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\n",
      "that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\n",
      "always make the most of it.”\n",
      "Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\n",
      "which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\n",
      "family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\n",
      "added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\n",
      "heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\n",
      "was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\n",
      "pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\n",
      "had known anything of the matter.\n",
      "Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\n",
      "extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\n",
      "Hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\n",
      "allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\n",
      "Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXV.\n",
      "After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.\n",
      "Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\n",
      "Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\n",
      "side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to\n",
      "hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\n",
      "would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\n",
      "of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\n",
      "his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\n",
      "another letter of thanks.\n",
      "On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\n",
      "brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at\n",
      "Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\n",
      "superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\n",
      "ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\n",
      "trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\n",
      "well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\n",
      "than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\n",
      "woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two\n",
      "eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.\n",
      "They had frequently been staying with her in town.\n",
      "The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to\n",
      "distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\n",
      "done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\n",
      "had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\n",
      "girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\n",
      "in it.\n",
      "“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.\n",
      "Bingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think\n",
      "that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it\n",
      "been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\n",
      "and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\n",
      "a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\n",
      "much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,\n",
      "sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\n",
      "them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\n",
      "so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\n",
      "before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\n",
      "greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of\n",
      "long sleeves.”\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\n",
      "the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her\n",
      "sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\n",
      "“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I\n",
      "am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,\n",
      "such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\n",
      "girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\n",
      "forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”\n",
      "“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not\n",
      "do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\n",
      "that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\n",
      "independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\n",
      "love with only a few days before.”\n",
      "“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\n",
      "doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\n",
      "often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s\n",
      "acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\n",
      "Mr. Bingley’s love?”\n",
      "“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\n",
      "inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\n",
      "they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\n",
      "offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\n",
      "spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be\n",
      "finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”\n",
      "“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\n",
      "Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\n",
      "over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\n",
      "would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\n",
      "be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\n",
      "service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\n",
      "anything.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\n",
      "of her sister’s ready acquiescence.\n",
      "“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to\n",
      "this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\n",
      "town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\n",
      "out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\n",
      "unless he really comes to see her.”\n",
      "“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\n",
      "friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\n",
      "part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\n",
      "perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\n",
      "would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\n",
      "impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\n",
      "never stirs without him.”\n",
      "“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\n",
      "correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”\n",
      "“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\n",
      "But, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\n",
      "point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\n",
      "withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\n",
      "convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\n",
      "hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\n",
      "his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\n",
      "successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s\n",
      "attractions.\n",
      "Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\n",
      "Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she\n",
      "hoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she\n",
      "might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\n",
      "seeing him.\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\n",
      "the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\n",
      "engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\n",
      "of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\n",
      "dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\n",
      "made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\n",
      "on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s\n",
      "warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\n",
      "them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\n",
      "of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\n",
      "resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\n",
      "Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\n",
      "an attachment.\n",
      "To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\n",
      "unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\n",
      "before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\n",
      "of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\n",
      "acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\n",
      "the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power\n",
      "to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been\n",
      "in the way of procuring.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\n",
      "character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible\n",
      "subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\n",
      "the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\n",
      "tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\n",
      "delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\n",
      "present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\n",
      "that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might\n",
      "agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having\n",
      "heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,\n",
      "ill-natured boy.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVI.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on\n",
      "the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after\n",
      "honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--\n",
      "“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\n",
      "are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\n",
      "openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\n",
      "yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\n",
      "fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\n",
      "_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\n",
      "ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\n",
      "must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\n",
      "expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\n",
      "good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\n",
      "“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\n",
      "“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\n",
      "“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\n",
      "myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\n",
      "can prevent it.”\n",
      "“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\n",
      "“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\n",
      "Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\n",
      "the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\n",
      "me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\n",
      "of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does\n",
      "me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\n",
      "father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\n",
      "should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\n",
      "since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\n",
      "seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\n",
      "engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\n",
      "of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\n",
      "it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is\n",
      "not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\n",
      "first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\n",
      "short, I will do my best.”\n",
      "“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\n",
      "often. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”\n",
      "“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very\n",
      "true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\n",
      "that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\n",
      "so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the\n",
      "necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\n",
      "honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\n",
      "are satisfied.”\n",
      "Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for\n",
      "the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice\n",
      "being given on such a point without being resented.\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\n",
      "by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the\n",
      "Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His\n",
      "marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned\n",
      "as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured\n",
      "tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the\n",
      "wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and\n",
      "when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s\n",
      "ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\n",
      "accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,\n",
      "Charlotte said,--\n",
      "“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\n",
      "“_That_ you certainly shall.”\n",
      "“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”\n",
      "“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\n",
      "“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\n",
      "come to Hunsford.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\n",
      "visit.\n",
      "“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and\n",
      "I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be\n",
      "as welcome to me as either of them.”\n",
      "The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\n",
      "the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the\n",
      "subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their\n",
      "correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it\n",
      "should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\n",
      "address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;\n",
      "and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\n",
      "sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters\n",
      "were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be\n",
      "curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\n",
      "like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\n",
      "be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\n",
      "expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\n",
      "wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\n",
      "which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\n",
      "roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most\n",
      "friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and\n",
      "Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\n",
      "for her own visit there, to know the rest.\n",
      "Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their\n",
      "safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\n",
      "would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\n",
      "Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\n",
      "generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or\n",
      "hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\n",
      "her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\n",
      "town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\n",
      "She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\n",
      "“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very\n",
      "glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\n",
      "to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.\n",
      "I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\n",
      "engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\n",
      "Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was\n",
      "not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\n",
      "soon see them here.”\n",
      "Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\n",
      "accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.\n",
      "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\n",
      "persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\n",
      "blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\n",
      "for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\n",
      "visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet\n",
      "more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself\n",
      "no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\n",
      "will prove what she felt:--\n",
      "     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\n",
      "     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have\n",
      "     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my\n",
      "     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\n",
      "     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\n",
      "     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\n",
      "     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\n",
      "     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n",
      "     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n",
      "     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she\n",
      "     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she\n",
      "     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\n",
      "     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\n",
      "     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\n",
      "     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\n",
      "     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\n",
      "     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n",
      "     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n",
      "     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n",
      "     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\n",
      "     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n",
      "     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n",
      "     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n",
      "     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\n",
      "     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all\n",
      "     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\n",
      "     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n",
      "     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n",
      "     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\n",
      "     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\n",
      "     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n",
      "     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful\n",
      "     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\n",
      "     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear\n",
      "     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never\n",
      "     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\n",
      "     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely\n",
      "     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at\n",
      "     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am\n",
      "     sure you will be very comfortable there.\n",
      "“Yours, etc.”\n",
      "This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she\n",
      "considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\n",
      "All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\n",
      "even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every\n",
      "review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\n",
      "advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\n",
      "Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly\n",
      "regret what he had thrown away.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\n",
      "concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had\n",
      "such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\n",
      "herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\n",
      "he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\n",
      "see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\n",
      "Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\n",
      "with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\n",
      "permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\n",
      "remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\n",
      "agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\n",
      "in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\n",
      "Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to\n",
      "suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\n",
      "ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\n",
      "sincerely wish him happy.\n",
      "All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the\n",
      "circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\n",
      "that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\n",
      "pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\n",
      "and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\n",
      "towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\n",
      "out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think\n",
      "her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\n",
      "watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more\n",
      "interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love\n",
      "with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\n",
      "Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\n",
      "his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways\n",
      "of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\n",
      "handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the\n",
      "plain.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVII.\n",
      "With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\n",
      "diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\n",
      "sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\n",
      "Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\n",
      "going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the\n",
      "plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater\n",
      "pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire\n",
      "of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.\n",
      "There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such\n",
      "uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\n",
      "was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give\n",
      "her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\n",
      "been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\n",
      "and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was\n",
      "to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\n",
      "spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as\n",
      "perfect as plan could be.\n",
      "The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\n",
      "and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\n",
      "told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\n",
      "The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\n",
      "his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\n",
      "Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\n",
      "first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\n",
      "of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\n",
      "she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\n",
      "opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\n",
      "was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to\n",
      "him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,\n",
      "whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\n",
      "and pleasing.\n",
      "Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think\n",
      "him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\n",
      "good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\n",
      "that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\n",
      "delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\n",
      "she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\n",
      "the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\n",
      "worn out, like his information.\n",
      "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\n",
      "as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s\n",
      "door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when\n",
      "they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\n",
      "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\n",
      "lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\n",
      "whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\n",
      "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\n",
      "for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\n",
      "kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\n",
      "shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n",
      "Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\n",
      "sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\n",
      "her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\n",
      "spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\n",
      "hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\n",
      "particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\n",
      "repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\n",
      "herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\n",
      "complimented her on bearing it so well.\n",
      "“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I\n",
      "should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\n",
      "“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\n",
      "between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\n",
      "and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\n",
      "because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\n",
      "girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\n",
      "mercenary.”\n",
      "“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\n",
      "what to think.”\n",
      "“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”\n",
      "“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death\n",
      "made her mistress of this fortune?”\n",
      "“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\n",
      "affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\n",
      "making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\n",
      "poor?”\n",
      "“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so\n",
      "soon after this event.”\n",
      "“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\n",
      "decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\n",
      "why should _we_?”\n",
      "“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\n",
      "deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”\n",
      "“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\n",
      "mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\n",
      "“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\n",
      "to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”\n",
      "“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\n",
      "Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\n",
      "much better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow\n",
      "where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\n",
      "neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\n",
      "worth knowing, after all.”\n",
      "“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”\n",
      "Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\n",
      "unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\n",
      "a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\n",
      "“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”\n",
      "No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\n",
      "acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear\n",
      "aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me\n",
      "fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men\n",
      "to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And\n",
      "when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\n",
      "being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where\n",
      "we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,\n",
      "and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when\n",
      "we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling\n",
      "about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less\n",
      "insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVIII.\n",
      "Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\n",
      "Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\n",
      "seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\n",
      "and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\n",
      "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\n",
      "search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\n",
      "The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\n",
      "smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n",
      "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\n",
      "road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,\n",
      "everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\n",
      "appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which\n",
      "led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\n",
      "the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\n",
      "at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\n",
      "liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\n",
      "coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\n",
      "instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:\n",
      "his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\n",
      "minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\n",
      "family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\n",
      "neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\n",
      "in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\n",
      "formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\n",
      "offers of refreshment.\n",
      "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\n",
      "fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\n",
      "and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\n",
      "wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\n",
      "everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\n",
      "by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\n",
      "that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\n",
      "Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\n",
      "which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\n",
      "Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\n",
      "Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\n",
      "every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\n",
      "fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\n",
      "happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\n",
      "garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\n",
      "which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\n",
      "respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\n",
      "with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\n",
      "owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\n",
      "through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\n",
      "interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\n",
      "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\n",
      "fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\n",
      "the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\n",
      "the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\n",
      "the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\n",
      "bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\n",
      "handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\n",
      "but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\n",
      "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\n",
      "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\n",
      "probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\n",
      "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\n",
      "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\n",
      "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\n",
      "forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\n",
      "Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n",
      "forgotten.\n",
      "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\n",
      "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\n",
      "in, observed,--\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\n",
      "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\n",
      "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\n",
      "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\n",
      "service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\n",
      "include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n",
      "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\n",
      "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\n",
      "walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n",
      "_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\n",
      "“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\n",
      "Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\n",
      "“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\n",
      "woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\n",
      "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\n",
      "telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\n",
      "Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\n",
      "Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\n",
      "and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\n",
      "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\n",
      "pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\n",
      "interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\n",
      "with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n",
      "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\n",
      "for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\n",
      "confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\n",
      "upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\n",
      "the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\n",
      "agitation, cried out,--\n",
      "“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\n",
      "there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\n",
      "haste, and come down this moment.”\n",
      "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;\n",
      "and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest\n",
      "of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the\n",
      "garden gate.\n",
      "“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\n",
      "were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\n",
      "daughter!”\n",
      "“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady\n",
      "Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\n",
      "other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\n",
      "creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”\n",
      "“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\n",
      "Why does she not come in?”\n",
      "“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\n",
      "when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”\n",
      "“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\n",
      "looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\n",
      "make him a very proper wife.”\n",
      "Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\n",
      "with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was\n",
      "stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\n",
      "before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\n",
      "way.\n",
      "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\n",
      "the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\n",
      "girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\n",
      "Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\n",
      "to dine at Rosings the next day.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIX.\n",
      "Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\n",
      "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\n",
      "visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\n",
      "wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\n",
      "doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady\n",
      "Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\n",
      "“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\n",
      "her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\n",
      "at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\n",
      "it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\n",
      "Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine\n",
      "there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\n",
      "immediately after your arrival?”\n",
      "“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\n",
      "“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\n",
      "my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\n",
      "instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\n",
      "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\n",
      "visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\n",
      "they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\n",
      "so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n",
      "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\n",
      "Elizabeth,--\n",
      "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\n",
      "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\n",
      "becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\n",
      "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\n",
      "for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\n",
      "being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n",
      "preserved.”\n",
      "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\n",
      "doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\n",
      "objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\n",
      "her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\n",
      "who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her\n",
      "introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\n",
      "to his presentation at St. James’s.\n",
      "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\n",
      "across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\n",
      "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\n",
      "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\n",
      "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\n",
      "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\n",
      "cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n",
      "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\n",
      "increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\n",
      "Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\n",
      "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\n",
      "thought she could witness without trepidation.\n",
      "From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\n",
      "rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\n",
      "the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\n",
      "her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\n",
      "condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\n",
      "with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\n",
      "performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\n",
      "which he would have thought necessary.\n",
      "In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\n",
      "awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\n",
      "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\n",
      "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\n",
      "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\n",
      "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\n",
      "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\n",
      "features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\n",
      "conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\n",
      "visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\n",
      "silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\n",
      "marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\n",
      "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\n",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\n",
      "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\n",
      "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\n",
      "being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\n",
      "likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\n",
      "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\n",
      "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\n",
      "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\n",
      "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\n",
      "her eyes.\n",
      "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\n",
      "admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\n",
      "and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\n",
      "looking at in the summer.\n",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\n",
      "and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\n",
      "had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\n",
      "her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\n",
      "nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\n",
      "and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\n",
      "was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\n",
      "manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\n",
      "Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\n",
      "gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\n",
      "to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\n",
      "to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\n",
      "Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\n",
      "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\n",
      "the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\n",
      "little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\n",
      "fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\n",
      "and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\n",
      "done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\n",
      "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\n",
      "subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\n",
      "her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\n",
      "concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\n",
      "to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\n",
      "regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\n",
      "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\n",
      "beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\n",
      "occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\n",
      "Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\n",
      "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\n",
      "the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\n",
      "pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\n",
      "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\n",
      "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\n",
      "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\n",
      "mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\n",
      "questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\n",
      "observed,--\n",
      "“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\n",
      "sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\n",
      "occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\n",
      "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\n",
      "Bennet?”\n",
      "“A little.”\n",
      "“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\n",
      "instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\n",
      "some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\n",
      "“One of them does.”\n",
      "“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\n",
      "Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\n",
      "you draw?”\n",
      "“No, not at all.”\n",
      "“What, none of you?”\n",
      "“Not one.”\n",
      "“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\n",
      "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\n",
      "“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\n",
      "“Has your governess left you?”\n",
      "“We never had any governess.”\n",
      "“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\n",
      "without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\n",
      "have been quite a slave to your education.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\n",
      "been the case.\n",
      "“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\n",
      "have been neglected.”\n",
      "“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\n",
      "wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\n",
      "read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\n",
      "idle certainly might.”\n",
      "“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\n",
      "known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\n",
      "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\n",
      "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\n",
      "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\n",
      "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\n",
      "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\n",
      "it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\n",
      "was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n",
      "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\n",
      "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\n",
      "Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\n",
      "younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, all.”\n",
      "“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\n",
      "younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\n",
      "be very young?”\n",
      "“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\n",
      "in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\n",
      "younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\n",
      "amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\n",
      "marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\n",
      "as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\n",
      "not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\n",
      "for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\n",
      "“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\n",
      "Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\n",
      "and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\n",
      "dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n",
      "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\n",
      "conceal your age.”\n",
      "“I am not one-and-twenty.”\n",
      "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\n",
      "were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\n",
      "down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\n",
      "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\n",
      "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\n",
      "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\n",
      "expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\n",
      "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\n",
      "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\n",
      "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\n",
      "was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\n",
      "for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\n",
      "Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\n",
      "and noble names.\n",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\n",
      "the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\n",
      "gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\n",
      "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\n",
      "to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\n",
      "arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\n",
      "Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\n",
      "soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\n",
      "cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\n",
      "for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\n",
      "her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\n",
      "satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s\n",
      "praise into his own hands.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXX.\n",
      "Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long\n",
      "enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,\n",
      "and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\n",
      "often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\n",
      "mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but\n",
      "when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\n",
      "and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\n",
      "cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast\n",
      "and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in\n",
      "reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,\n",
      "which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\n",
      "Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\n",
      "the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\n",
      "pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\n",
      "reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\n",
      "much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and\n",
      "she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n",
      "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\n",
      "were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\n",
      "along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\n",
      "which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\n",
      "almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\n",
      "a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\n",
      "prevailed on to get out.\n",
      "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\n",
      "not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\n",
      "and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\n",
      "to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\n",
      "hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\n",
      "and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\n",
      "these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\n",
      "and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\n",
      "of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\n",
      "accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\n",
      "out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.\n",
      "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\n",
      "commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\n",
      "in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\n",
      "Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\n",
      "quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\n",
      "village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\n",
      "them into harmony and plenty.\n",
      "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\n",
      "and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\n",
      "card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\n",
      "of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\n",
      "of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,\n",
      "however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\n",
      "comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\n",
      "Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\n",
      "had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\n",
      "she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\n",
      "along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\n",
      "a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\n",
      "where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.\n",
      "In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\n",
      "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\n",
      "addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\n",
      "important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\n",
      "was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\n",
      "not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\n",
      "furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\n",
      "she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him\n",
      "were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\n",
      "by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\n",
      "satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\n",
      "seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\n",
      "Miss Lucas and herself.\n",
      "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\n",
      "the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\n",
      "in order to have\n",
      "the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\n",
      "turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\n",
      "following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\n",
      "two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought\n",
      "with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\n",
      "and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\n",
      "the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\n",
      "husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\n",
      "other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--\n",
      "“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\n",
      "never have come so soon to wait upon me.”\n",
      "Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\n",
      "before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\n",
      "afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\n",
      "who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\n",
      "address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\n",
      "used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\n",
      "reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\n",
      "friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\n",
      "courtesied to him, without saying a word.\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the\n",
      "readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\n",
      "his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\n",
      "garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\n",
      "At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\n",
      "Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\n",
      "way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--\n",
      "“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\n",
      "happened to see her there?”\n",
      "She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see\n",
      "whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\n",
      "Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\n",
      "answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\n",
      "subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\n",
      "away.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXI.\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\n",
      "and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\n",
      "their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\n",
      "received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\n",
      "house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\n",
      "almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by\n",
      "such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\n",
      "come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\n",
      "of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\n",
      "at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\n",
      "only seen at church.\n",
      "The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined\n",
      "the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them\n",
      "civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\n",
      "acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\n",
      "almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\n",
      "much more than to any other person in the room.\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\n",
      "welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,\n",
      "moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\n",
      "talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\n",
      "at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\n",
      "well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\n",
      "spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\n",
      "well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\n",
      "towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a\n",
      "while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\n",
      "scruple to call out,--\n",
      "“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\n",
      "of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”\n",
      "“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid\n",
      "a reply.\n",
      "“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\n",
      "must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\n",
      "There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\n",
      "enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\n",
      "learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\n",
      "health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\n",
      "performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.\n",
      "“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\n",
      "Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\n",
      "if she does not practise a great deal.”\n",
      "“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\n",
      "She practises very constantly.”\n",
      "“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\n",
      "to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\n",
      "tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\n",
      "constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\n",
      "never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\n",
      "Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\n",
      "her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\n",
      "Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part\n",
      "of the house.”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made\n",
      "no answer.\n",
      "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\n",
      "promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\n",
      "drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\n",
      "talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\n",
      "her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\n",
      "stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s\n",
      "countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\n",
      "convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--\n",
      "“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\n",
      "me. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\n",
      "There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\n",
      "the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\n",
      "intimidate me.”\n",
      "“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could\n",
      "not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\n",
      "have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\n",
      "find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\n",
      "are not your own.”\n",
      "Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\n",
      "me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\n",
      "in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\n",
      "part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\n",
      "of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\n",
      "all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\n",
      "leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\n",
      "and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\n",
      "“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.\n",
      "“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”\n",
      "“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\n",
      "first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\n",
      "a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\n",
      "dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\n",
      "dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more\n",
      "than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "you cannot deny the fact.”\n",
      "“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\n",
      "beyond my own party.”\n",
      "“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”\n",
      "“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an\n",
      "introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”\n",
      "“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\n",
      "addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\n",
      "education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\n",
      "himself to strangers?”\n",
      "“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to\n",
      "him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\n",
      "“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,\n",
      "“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\n",
      "catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\n",
      "concerns, as I often see done.”\n",
      "“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\n",
      "masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same\n",
      "force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\n",
      "have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take\n",
      "the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\n",
      "as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”\n",
      "Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your\n",
      "time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\n",
      "think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\n",
      "what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\n",
      "Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\n",
      "to Darcy,--\n",
      "“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\n",
      "could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\n",
      "of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have\n",
      "been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”\n",
      "Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his\n",
      "cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\n",
      "discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\n",
      "De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\n",
      "been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\n",
      "Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing\n",
      "with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\n",
      "them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\n",
      "gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was\n",
      "ready to take them all home.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXII.\n",
      "Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\n",
      "while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\n",
      "when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\n",
      "visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\n",
      "Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her\n",
      "half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,\n",
      "when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\n",
      "Darcy only, entered the room.\n",
      "He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his\n",
      "intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\n",
      "be within.\n",
      "They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\n",
      "seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\n",
      "necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\n",
      "recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\n",
      "curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\n",
      "departure, she observed,--\n",
      "“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\n",
      "all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\n",
      "before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”\n",
      "“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\n",
      "She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\n",
      "pause, added,--\n",
      "“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\n",
      "returning to Netherfield again?”\n",
      "“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\n",
      "very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\n",
      "at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\n",
      "increasing.”\n",
      "“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\n",
      "neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\n",
      "might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\n",
      "not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\n",
      "for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\n",
      "principle.”\n",
      "“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\n",
      "soon as any eligible purchase offers.”\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\n",
      "friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\n",
      "trouble of finding a subject to him.\n",
      "He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable\n",
      "house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\n",
      "Collins first came to Hunsford.”\n",
      "“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\n",
      "kindness on a more grateful object.”\n",
      "“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”\n",
      "“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\n",
      "the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\n",
      "him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\n",
      "I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\n",
      "thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\n",
      "prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”\n",
      "“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\n",
      "distance of her own family and friends.”\n",
      "“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\n",
      "“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s\n",
      "journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\n",
      "“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\n",
      "of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins\n",
      "was settled _near_ her family.”\n",
      "“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\n",
      "the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”\n",
      "As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\n",
      "understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\n",
      "Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--\n",
      "“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\n",
      "family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\n",
      "varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\n",
      "travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\n",
      "case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\n",
      "such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\n",
      "friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\n",
      "the present distance.”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot\n",
      "have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\n",
      "been always at Longbourn.”\n",
      "Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\n",
      "feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\n",
      "glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--\n",
      "“Are you pleased with Kent?”\n",
      "A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\n",
      "calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\n",
      "and her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_\n",
      "surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\n",
      "intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\n",
      "without saying much to anybody, went away.\n",
      "“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was\n",
      "gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\n",
      "have called on us in this familiar way.”\n",
      "But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\n",
      "even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various\n",
      "conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\n",
      "the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\n",
      "from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\n",
      "was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\n",
      "always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\n",
      "pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\n",
      "two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\n",
      "almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\n",
      "separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\n",
      "aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\n",
      "had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\n",
      "him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\n",
      "being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\n",
      "favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\n",
      "was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\n",
      "believed he might have the best informed mind.\n",
      "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult\n",
      "to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\n",
      "ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\n",
      "seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\n",
      "propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\n",
      "animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\n",
      "generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\n",
      "her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\n",
      "love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\n",
      "seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\n",
      "Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\n",
      "certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\n",
      "look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\n",
      "doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\n",
      "seemed nothing but absence of mind.\n",
      "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\n",
      "being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\n",
      "Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\n",
      "raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\n",
      "opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would\n",
      "vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\n",
      "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\n",
      "certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\n",
      "to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\n",
      "in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXIII.\n",
      "More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\n",
      "unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\n",
      "mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\n",
      "prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\n",
      "that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\n",
      "therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\n",
      "wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\n",
      "not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\n",
      "but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\n",
      "never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\n",
      "or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\n",
      "encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\n",
      "pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\n",
      "opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of\n",
      "Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\n",
      "expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\n",
      "_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\n",
      "mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\n",
      "a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\n",
      "pales opposite the Parsonage.\n",
      "She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last\n",
      "letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\n",
      "written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\n",
      "Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--\n",
      "“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\n",
      "“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\n",
      "do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\n",
      "Are you going much farther?”\n",
      "“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\n",
      "And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\n",
      "together.\n",
      "“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\n",
      "“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\n",
      "arranges the business just as he pleases.”\n",
      "“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\n",
      "great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\n",
      "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\n",
      "“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
      "“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\n",
      "many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\n",
      "feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\n",
      "dependence.”\n",
      "“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\n",
      "either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\n",
      "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\n",
      "wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\n",
      "“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\n",
      "experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\n",
      "weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\n",
      "where they like.”\n",
      "“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\n",
      "my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\n",
      "money.”\n",
      "“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\n",
      "idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is\n",
      "the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\n",
      "very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\n",
      "He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\n",
      "a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\n",
      "she soon afterwards said,--\n",
      "“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\n",
      "having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\n",
      "lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\n",
      "for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\n",
      "likes with her.”\n",
      "“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\n",
      "divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\n",
      "“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\n",
      "your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\n",
      "a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\n",
      "may like to have her own way.”\n",
      "As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\n",
      "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\n",
      "give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\n",
      "got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\n",
      "“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\n",
      "say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\n",
      "very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\n",
      "Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\n",
      "“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\n",
      "man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\n",
      "“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\n",
      "Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\n",
      "“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\n",
      "those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\n",
      "in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\n",
      "to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\n",
      "that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\n",
      "“What is it you mean?”\n",
      "“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\n",
      "generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\n",
      "would be an unpleasant thing.”\n",
      "“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\n",
      "“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\n",
      "Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\n",
      "on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\n",
      "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\n",
      "particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\n",
      "the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\n",
      "knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\n",
      "“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\n",
      "“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\n",
      "lady.”\n",
      "“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\n",
      "“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\n",
      "only told me what I have now told you.”\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\n",
      "indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\n",
      "was so thoughtful.\n",
      "“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\n",
      "cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\n",
      "judge?”\n",
      "“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\n",
      "“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\n",
      "friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\n",
      "determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\n",
      "she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\n",
      "particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\n",
      "that there was much affection in the case.”\n",
      "“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\n",
      "lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\n",
      "This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\n",
      "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\n",
      "matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\n",
      "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\n",
      "of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\n",
      "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\n",
      "could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\n",
      "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\n",
      "taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\n",
      "had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\n",
      "arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n",
      "_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\n",
      "Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\n",
      "while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\n",
      "in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\n",
      "inflicted.\n",
      "“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\n",
      "having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\n",
      "business in London.\n",
      "“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\n",
      "objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\n",
      "excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\n",
      "anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\n",
      "peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\n",
      "and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\n",
      "of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\n",
      "not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\n",
      "Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\n",
      "the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\n",
      "of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\n",
      "governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\n",
      "retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n",
      "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\n",
      "headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\n",
      "her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\n",
      "cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\n",
      "seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\n",
      "as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\n",
      "could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather\n",
      "displeased by her staying at home.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXIV.\n",
      "When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\n",
      "much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\n",
      "examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\n",
      "being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\n",
      "revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\n",
      "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\n",
      "cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\n",
      "proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\n",
      "disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\n",
      "noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\n",
      "attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\n",
      "keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\n",
      "think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\n",
      "and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\n",
      "with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\n",
      "spirits, by all that affection could do.\n",
      "She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his\n",
      "cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\n",
      "that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\n",
      "mean to be unhappy about him.\n",
      "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\n",
      "door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\n",
      "being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\n",
      "the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But\n",
      "this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\n",
      "affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\n",
      "room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\n",
      "health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\n",
      "She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\n",
      "then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\n",
      "said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\n",
      "in an agitated manner, and thus began:--\n",
      "“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\n",
      "repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\n",
      "doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\n",
      "and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\n",
      "followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\n",
      "heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\n",
      "tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\n",
      "degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\n",
      "to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\n",
      "consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\n",
      "suit.\n",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\n",
      "the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\n",
      "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\n",
      "receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\n",
      "all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\n",
      "answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\n",
      "representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\n",
      "all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\n",
      "expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\n",
      "his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\n",
      "favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\n",
      "countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\n",
      "exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\n",
      "and she said,--\n",
      "“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\n",
      "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\n",
      "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\n",
      "felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\n",
      "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\n",
      "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\n",
      "anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\n",
      "of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\n",
      "the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\n",
      "overcoming it after this explanation.”\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\n",
      "on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\n",
      "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\n",
      "his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\n",
      "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\n",
      "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\n",
      "dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\n",
      "“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\n",
      "might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\n",
      "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\n",
      "“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\n",
      "of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\n",
      "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n",
      "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\n",
      "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\n",
      "against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\n",
      "favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\n",
      "the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\n",
      "happiness of a most beloved sister?”\n",
      "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\n",
      "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\n",
      "continued,--\n",
      "“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\n",
      "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\n",
      "you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\n",
      "of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\n",
      "world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\n",
      "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\n",
      "kind.”\n",
      "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\n",
      "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n",
      "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n",
      "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\n",
      "With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\n",
      "that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\n",
      "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\n",
      "kinder than towards myself.”\n",
      "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\n",
      "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n",
      "“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\n",
      "is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\n",
      "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\n",
      "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\n",
      "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n",
      "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\n",
      "“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\n",
      "in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n",
      "“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\n",
      "interest in him?”\n",
      "“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\n",
      "misfortunes have been great indeed.”\n",
      "“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\n",
      "reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\n",
      "have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\n",
      "for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\n",
      "independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\n",
      "all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\n",
      "contempt and ridicule.”\n",
      "“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n",
      "“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\n",
      "thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\n",
      "calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\n",
      "walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\n",
      "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\n",
      "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n",
      "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\n",
      "policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\n",
      "being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\n",
      "reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n",
      "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\n",
      "Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\n",
      "connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\n",
      "condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\n",
      "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\n",
      "the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\n",
      "“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\n",
      "declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\n",
      "concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\n",
      "more gentlemanlike manner.”\n",
      "She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\n",
      "“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\n",
      "that would have tempted me to accept it.”\n",
      "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n",
      "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\n",
      "“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\n",
      "acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\n",
      "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\n",
      "feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\n",
      "disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\n",
      "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n",
      "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\n",
      "“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\n",
      "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n",
      "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\n",
      "wishes for your health and happiness.”\n",
      "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\n",
      "the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\n",
      "her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\n",
      "and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\n",
      "astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\n",
      "every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\n",
      "Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\n",
      "so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\n",
      "which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\n",
      "must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\n",
      "incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\n",
      "an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\n",
      "of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\n",
      "acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\n",
      "which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\n",
      "attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\n",
      "attachment had for a moment excited.\n",
      "She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\n",
      "Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\n",
      "Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXV.\n",
      "Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\n",
      "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\n",
      "surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\n",
      "else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\n",
      "breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\n",
      "directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\n",
      "she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\n",
      "park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\n",
      "of the gates into the ground.\n",
      "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\n",
      "tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\n",
      "look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\n",
      "made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\n",
      "verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\n",
      "walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\n",
      "which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\n",
      "now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\n",
      "pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\n",
      "though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\n",
      "towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\n",
      "a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\n",
      "composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\n",
      "meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\n",
      "then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\n",
      "out of sight.\n",
      "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\n",
      "Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\n",
      "perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\n",
      "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\n",
      "full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\n",
      "from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n",
      "“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\n",
      "its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\n",
      "offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\n",
      "intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\n",
      "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n",
      "effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\n",
      "should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\n",
      "and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\n",
      "your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\n",
      "demand it of your justice.\n",
      "“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n",
      "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\n",
      "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\n",
      "from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\n",
      "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\n",
      "prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\n",
      "wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\n",
      "favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\n",
      "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\n",
      "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\n",
      "persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\n",
      "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\n",
      "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\n",
      "to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\n",
      "their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\n",
      "to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\n",
      "offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\n",
      "be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\n",
      "Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\n",
      "preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\n",
      "it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\n",
      "apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\n",
      "in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\n",
      "you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\n",
      "information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\n",
      "a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\n",
      "event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n",
      "observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\n",
      "that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\n",
      "in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\n",
      "cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\n",
      "regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\n",
      "though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\n",
      "them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\n",
      "here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\n",
      "sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\n",
      "by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n",
      "unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\n",
      "your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\n",
      "acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\n",
      "was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\n",
      "her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\n",
      "investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\n",
      "fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\n",
      "believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\n",
      "My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\n",
      "acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\n",
      "in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n",
      "my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\n",
      "which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\n",
      "instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\n",
      "immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\n",
      "situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\n",
      "comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\n",
      "uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\n",
      "occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\n",
      "you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\n",
      "and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n",
      "consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\n",
      "any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\n",
      "you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\n",
      "disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\n",
      "that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\n",
      "inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\n",
      "friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\n",
      "Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\n",
      "remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\n",
      "now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\n",
      "with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\n",
      "sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\n",
      "shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\n",
      "went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\n",
      "friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\n",
      "earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\n",
      "his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\n",
      "prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\n",
      "I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\n",
      "believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\n",
      "regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\n",
      "dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\n",
      "that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\n",
      "him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\n",
      "given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\n",
      "having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\n",
      "affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\n",
      "condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\n",
      "your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\n",
      "Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\n",
      "have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\n",
      "did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\n",
      "danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\n",
      "done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\n",
      "nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\n",
      "sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n",
      "governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\n",
      "yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\n",
      "accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\n",
      "laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\n",
      "has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\n",
      "shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\n",
      "the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\n",
      "the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\n",
      "to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\n",
      "therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n",
      "afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\n",
      "always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\n",
      "give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\n",
      "young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\n",
      "highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\n",
      "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\n",
      "since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\n",
      "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\n",
      "guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\n",
      "observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\n",
      "had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\n",
      "could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\n",
      "only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\n",
      "created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\n",
      "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n",
      "died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\n",
      "last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\n",
      "promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\n",
      "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\n",
      "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\n",
      "one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\n",
      "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\n",
      "that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\n",
      "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n",
      "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n",
      "benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\n",
      "must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\n",
      "insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\n",
      "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\n",
      "proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\n",
      "business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\n",
      "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n",
      "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n",
      "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n",
      "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\n",
      "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\n",
      "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\n",
      "dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\n",
      "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\n",
      "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\n",
      "circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\n",
      "were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n",
      "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\n",
      "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\n",
      "doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\n",
      "and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\n",
      "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\n",
      "resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\n",
      "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\n",
      "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\n",
      "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\n",
      "know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\n",
      "notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n",
      "myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\n",
      "to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\n",
      "your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\n",
      "to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\n",
      "myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\n",
      "establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\n",
      "the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\n",
      "Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\n",
      "acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\n",
      "most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\n",
      "recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\n",
      "strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\n",
      "persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\n",
      "was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n",
      "imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n",
      "herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\n",
      "elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\n",
      "and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\n",
      "acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\n",
      "acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\n",
      "exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\n",
      "and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\n",
      "chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\n",
      "thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\n",
      "himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\n",
      "complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\n",
      "which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\n",
      "reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n",
      "towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n",
      "falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\n",
      "wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\n",
      "either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\n",
      "not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\n",
      "told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\n",
      "what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\n",
      "related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\n",
      "still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\n",
      "unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\n",
      "your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\n",
      "cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\n",
      "that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\n",
      "to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\n",
      "course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\n",
      "“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXVI.\n",
      "Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\n",
      "contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\n",
      "its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\n",
      "she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\n",
      "Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\n",
      "she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\n",
      "and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to\n",
      "give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\n",
      "prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\n",
      "what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\n",
      "hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\n",
      "what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\n",
      "sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s\n",
      "insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the\n",
      "real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\n",
      "wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\n",
      "which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\n",
      "pride and insolence.\n",
      "But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\n",
      "she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\n",
      "if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\n",
      "bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\n",
      "were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\n",
      "Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\n",
      "to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\n",
      "This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had\n",
      "gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\n",
      "last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\n",
      "regard it, that she would never look in it again.\n",
      "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\n",
      "nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\n",
      "was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\n",
      "again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\n",
      "commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\n",
      "The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly\n",
      "what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\n",
      "own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\n",
      "the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\n",
      "was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\n",
      "impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\n",
      "other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\n",
      "not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\n",
      "particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\n",
      "to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\n",
      "thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\n",
      "letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\n",
      "impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\n",
      "little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\n",
      "But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\n",
      "believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\n",
      "render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\n",
      "turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n",
      "The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\n",
      "Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\n",
      "bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\n",
      "entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\n",
      "persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\n",
      "had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\n",
      "nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\n",
      "himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\n",
      "she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and\n",
      "manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\n",
      "She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\n",
      "trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\n",
      "attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\n",
      "for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\n",
      "Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\n",
      "continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\n",
      "instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\n",
      "remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\n",
      "the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\n",
      "more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\n",
      "designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\n",
      "between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at\n",
      "last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\n",
      "information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose\n",
      "character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\n",
      "resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\n",
      "of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\n",
      "Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been\n",
      "well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.\n",
      "She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\n",
      "between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.\n",
      "Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\n",
      "struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\n",
      "wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\n",
      "himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\n",
      "with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\n",
      "of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n",
      "_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\n",
      "the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\n",
      "family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\n",
      "herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\n",
      "that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\n",
      "always prevent his exposing the son.\n",
      "How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\n",
      "attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\n",
      "hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\n",
      "the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\n",
      "His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\n",
      "either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\n",
      "his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\n",
      "incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\n",
      "and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\n",
      "but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\n",
      "asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\n",
      "were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\n",
      "acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\n",
      "together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\n",
      "that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\n",
      "of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\n",
      "esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\n",
      "brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\n",
      "sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\n",
      "actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\n",
      "everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\n",
      "that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\n",
      "as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\n",
      "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\n",
      "could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\n",
      "prejudiced, absurd.\n",
      "“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on\n",
      "my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\n",
      "often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\n",
      "vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\n",
      "discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\n",
      "have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\n",
      "folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\n",
      "of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\n",
      "prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\n",
      "concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”\n",
      "From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\n",
      "which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation\n",
      "_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\n",
      "different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\n",
      "credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\n",
      "give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\n",
      "of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what\n",
      "Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\n",
      "of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\n",
      "fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\n",
      "complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\n",
      "sensibility.\n",
      "When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\n",
      "mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\n",
      "of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\n",
      "for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\n",
      "having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\n",
      "disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\n",
      "than on hers.\n",
      "The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but\n",
      "it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\n",
      "self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\n",
      "Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\n",
      "relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\n",
      "by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\n",
      "had ever known before.\n",
      "After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\n",
      "variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and\n",
      "reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so\n",
      "important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at\n",
      "length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing\n",
      "cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as\n",
      "must make her unfit for conversation.\n",
      "She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\n",
      "called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\n",
      "leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\n",
      "an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\n",
      "till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\n",
      "missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\n",
      "longer an object. She could think only of her letter.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXVII.\n",
      "The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having\n",
      "been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\n",
      "able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very\n",
      "good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\n",
      "melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\n",
      "hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\n",
      "brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,\n",
      "importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\n",
      "having them all to dine with her.\n",
      "Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\n",
      "she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her\n",
      "future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\n",
      "Ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how\n",
      "would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure\n",
      "you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody\n",
      "feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\n",
      "attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\n",
      "They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\n",
      "Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\n",
      "seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His\n",
      "attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\n",
      "Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\n",
      "were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\n",
      "Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\n",
      "spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\n",
      "she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\n",
      "“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\n",
      "may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\n",
      "company, I am sure.”\n",
      "“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied\n",
      "Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\n",
      "next Saturday.”\n",
      "“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\n",
      "you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\n",
      "can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\n",
      "spare you for another fortnight.”\n",
      "“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\n",
      "“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.\n",
      "Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will\n",
      "stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you\n",
      "as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and\n",
      "as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good\n",
      "room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be\n",
      "cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\n",
      "large.”\n",
      "“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\n",
      "original plan.”\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\n",
      "with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\n",
      "of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\n",
      "You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the\n",
      "world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\n",
      "guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\n",
      "niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\n",
      "having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\n",
      "Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\n",
      "propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\n",
      "things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am\n",
      "glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\n",
      "discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\n",
      "“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\n",
      "“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\n",
      "have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?\n",
      "Oh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\n",
      "attended to.”\n",
      "Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;\n",
      "and as she did not answer them all herself attention was\n",
      "necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a\n",
      "mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection\n",
      "must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave\n",
      "way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a\n",
      "solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of\n",
      "unpleasant recollections.\n",
      "Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\n",
      "studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\n",
      "times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\n",
      "she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly\n",
      "she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\n",
      "herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\n",
      "His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she\n",
      "could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\n",
      "feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\n",
      "behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in\n",
      "the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\n",
      "They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\n",
      "them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\n",
      "youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\n",
      "herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\n",
      "united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\n",
      "and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,\n",
      "what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\n",
      "irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\n",
      "affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\n",
      "scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\n",
      "there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\n",
      "Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\n",
      "ever.\n",
      "Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\n",
      "heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to\n",
      "have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\n",
      "could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\n",
      "grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\n",
      "respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\n",
      "been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\n",
      "When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s\n",
      "character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\n",
      "seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it\n",
      "almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\n",
      "Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\n",
      "her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\n",
      "there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\n",
      "their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\n",
      "and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\n",
      "way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\n",
      "work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\n",
      "When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\n",
      "a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\n",
      "and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out\n",
      "her hand to both.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXVIII.\n",
      "On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\n",
      "minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\n",
      "paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\n",
      "“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet\n",
      "expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\n",
      "certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\n",
      "it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know\n",
      "how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\n",
      "manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we\n",
      "see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\n",
      "yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\n",
      "and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending\n",
      "your time unpleasantly.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had\n",
      "spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\n",
      "Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel\n",
      "the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\n",
      "solemnity replied,--\n",
      "“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\n",
      "time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\n",
      "fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior\n",
      "society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of\n",
      "varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that\n",
      "your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation\n",
      "with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of\n",
      "extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on\n",
      "what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In\n",
      "truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this\n",
      "humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\n",
      "compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\n",
      "Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\n",
      "obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\n",
      "and truth in a few short sentences.\n",
      "“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\n",
      "Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will\n",
      "be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\n",
      "have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\n",
      "that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\n",
      "as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\n",
      "that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\n",
      "marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\n",
      "thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\n",
      "character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\n",
      "other.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\n",
      "the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\n",
      "and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\n",
      "have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\n",
      "whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such\n",
      "society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently\n",
      "regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for\n",
      "compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,\n",
      "and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\n",
      "At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\n",
      "placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\n",
      "parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\n",
      "Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\n",
      "her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\n",
      "for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\n",
      "compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed\n",
      "her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\n",
      "when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\n",
      "hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\n",
      "“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects\n",
      "delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\n",
      "while you have been here.”\n",
      "Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and\n",
      "the carriage drove off.\n",
      "“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems\n",
      "but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\n",
      "happened!”\n",
      "“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.\n",
      "“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\n",
      "How much I shall have to tell!”\n",
      "Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”\n",
      "Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\n",
      "within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s\n",
      "house, where they were to remain a few days.\n",
      "Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\n",
      "spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt\n",
      "had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\n",
      "Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\n",
      "It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\n",
      "Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know\n",
      "that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\n",
      "Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\n",
      "vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\n",
      "to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\n",
      "in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,\n",
      "and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\n",
      "repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\n",
      "further.\n",

      "It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\n",
      "together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\n",
      "and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was\n",
      "to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s\n",
      "punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.\n",
      "These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\n",
      "in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\n",
      "dressing a salad and cucumber.\n",
      "After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\n",
      "out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\n",

      "“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the\n",
      "money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing\n",
      "her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\n",
      "is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\n",
      "pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\n",
      "better.”\n",
      "And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\n",
      "unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\n",
      "when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\n",
      "think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\n",
      "one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\n",
      "are going in a fortnight.”\n",
      "“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\n",
      "“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\n",
      "take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\n",
      "and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\n",
      "go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\n",
      "have!”\n",
      "“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\n",
      "and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole\n",
      "campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\n",
      "regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”\n",
      "“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to\n",
      "table. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about\n",
      "a certain person that we all like.”\n",
      "Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\n",
      "need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--\n",
      "“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\n",
      "waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\n",
      "things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\n",
      "he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\n",
      "my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\n",
      "There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She\n",
      "is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\n",
      "“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\n",
      "imprudent as to fortune.”\n",
      "“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\n",
      "“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\n",
      "“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\n",
      "three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\n",
      "thing?”\n",
      "Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\n",
      "coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\n",
      "was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\n",
      "liberal!\n",
      "As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\n",
      "ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\n",
      "boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and\n",
      "Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\n",
      "“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my\n",
      "bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now\n",
      "let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\n",
      "home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\n",
      "since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\n",
      "flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\n",
      "before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\n",
      "She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\n",
      "being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\n",
      "get husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\n",
      "Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\n",
      "how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\n",
      "_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\n",
      "of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend\n",
      "the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\n",
      "evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\n",
      "she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\n",
      "was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\n",
      "dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a\n",
      "lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\n",
      "Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\n",
      "one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\n",
      "and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\n",
      "did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\n",
      "Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\n",
      "something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”\n",
      "With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\n",
      "assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\n",
      "companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\n",
      "could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.\n",
      "Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\n",
      "in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\n",
      "say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\n",
      "“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\n",
      "Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\n",
      "came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\n",
      "which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\n",
      "table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\n",
      "was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\n",
      "fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\n",
      "retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\n",
      "rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various\n",
      "pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\n",
      "“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\n",
      "as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\n",
      "there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\n",
      "Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\n",
      "behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\n",
      "cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\n",
      "treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\n",
      "we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\n",
      "And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\n",
      "loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\n",
      "To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,\n",
      "to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\n",
      "generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\n",
      "_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”\n",
      "But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\n",
      "anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\n",
      "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\n",
      "Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\n",
      "the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\n",
      "home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\n",
      "another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\n",
      "again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\n",
      "_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond\n",
      "expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped\n",
      "there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\n",
      "She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\n",
      "scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\n",
      "frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\n",
      "father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\n",
      "at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\n",
      "disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\n",
      "CHAPTER XL.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\n",
      "longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\n",
      "in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\n",
      "she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\n",
      "Darcy and herself.\n",
      "Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\n",
      "partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\n",
      "natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\n",
      "sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\n",
      "little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\n",
      "unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.\n",
      "“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly\n",
      "ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\n",
      "disappointment.”\n",
      "“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\n",
      "other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\n",
      "You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\n",
      "“Blame you! Oh, no.”\n",
      "“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\n",
      "“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\n",
      "“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\n",
      "next day.”\n",
      "She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\n",
      "as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\n",
      "who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\n",
      "so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\n",
      "collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though\n",
      "grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\n",
      "Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\n",
      "seek to clear one, without involving the other.\n",
      "“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\n",
      "of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\n",
      "with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\n",
      "enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\n",
      "about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\n",
      "Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\n",
      "It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n",
      "“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so\n",
      "very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\n",
      "only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\n",
      "with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\n",
      "thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\n",
      "feel it so.”\n",
      "“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full\n",
      "of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\n",
      "every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\n",
      "saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as\n",
      "light as a feather.”\n",
      "“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\n",
      "countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”\n",
      "“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\n",
      "two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\n",
      "appearance of it.”\n",
      "“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\n",
      "used to do.”\n",
      "“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\n",
      "to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an\n",
      "opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\n",
      "abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing\n",
      "at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”\n",
      "“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\n",
      "the matter as you do now.”\n",
      "“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very\n",
      "uncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I\n",
      "felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,\n",
      "and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”\n",
      "“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\n",
      "in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\n",
      "undeserved.”\n",
      "“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\n",
      "natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\n",
      "one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\n",
      "ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand\n",
      "Wickham’s character.”\n",
      "Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no\n",
      "occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”\n",
      "“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to\n",
      "make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\n",
      "relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\n",
      "myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\n",
      "conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\n",
      "so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\n",
      "Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to\n",
      "it. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to\n",
      "anybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found\n",
      "out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\n",
      "At present I will say nothing about it.”\n",
      "“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\n",
      "ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\n",
      "re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”\n",
      "The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She\n",
      "had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\n",
      "fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\n",
      "might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\n",
      "lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\n",
      "relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister\n",
      "how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\n",
      "which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than\n",
      "a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\n",
      "throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\n",
      "that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be\n",
      "able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\n",
      "himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost\n",
      "all its value!”\n",
      "She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\n",
      "state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\n",
      "very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in\n",
      "love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from\n",
      "her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often\n",
      "boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to\n",
      "every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\n",
      "feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those\n",
      "regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their\n",
      "tranquillity.\n",
      "“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of\n",
      "this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\n",
      "of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I\n",
      "cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a\n",
      "very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\n",
      "chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his\n",
      "coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\n",
      "everybody, too, who is likely to know.”\n",
      "“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”\n",
      "“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I\n",
      "shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was\n",
      "her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure\n",
      "Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\n",
      "has done.”\n",
      "But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she\n",
      "made no answer.\n",
      "“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\n",
      "Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it\n",
      "will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\n",
      "excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,\n",
      "she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\n",
      "housekeeping, I dare say.”\n",
      "“No, nothing at all.”\n",
      "“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will\n",
      "take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\n",
      "for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\n",
      "talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it\n",
      "quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”\n",
      "“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\n",
      "“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they\n",
      "often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\n",
      "estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be\n",
      "ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XLI.\n",
      "The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\n",
      "the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\n",
      "the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\n",
      "universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\n",
      "and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\n",
      "frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\n",
      "Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\n",
      "hard-heartedness in any of the family.\n",
      "“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they\n",
      "often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,\n",
      "Lizzy?”\n",
      "Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\n",
      "she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.\n",
      "“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel\n",
      "Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”\n",
      "“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.\n",
      "“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”\n",
      "“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”\n",
      "“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”\n",
      "added Kitty.\n",
      "Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\n",
      "Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\n",
      "of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\n",
      "interference in the views of his friend.\n",
      "But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\n",
      "received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the\n",
      "regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\n",
      "very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour\n",
      "and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\n",
      "their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\n",
      "The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\n",
      "the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\n",
      "to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew\n",
      "about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s\n",
      "congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\n",
      "whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\n",
      "in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n",
      "“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”\n",
      "said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\n",
      "right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\n",
      "her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\n",
      "exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\n",
      "considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\n",
      "for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it\n",
      "known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\n",
      "go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general\n",
      "behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\n",
      "such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\n",
      "imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\n",
      "be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--\n",
      "“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\n",
      "place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\n",
      "expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\n",
      "circumstances.”\n",
      "“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to\n",
      "us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and\n",
      "imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\n",
      "would judge differently in the affair.”\n",
      "“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away\n",
      "some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\n",
      "squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\n",
      "are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows\n",
      "who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”\n",
      "“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\n",
      "of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\n",
      "importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the\n",
      "wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\n",
      "Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\n",
      "father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\n",
      "of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\n",
      "her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\n",
      "will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\n",
      "that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the\n",
      "worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\n",
      "youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of\n",
      "her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n",
      "contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\n",
      "is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\n",
      "ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you\n",
      "suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\n",
      "they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\n",
      "disgrace?”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,\n",
      "affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--\n",
      "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,\n",
      "you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\n",
      "advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\n",
      "sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\n",
      "Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\n",
      "keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\n",
      "object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\n",
      "even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\n",
      "women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\n",
      "there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\n",
      "many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest\n",
      "of her life.”\n",
      "With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\n",
      "continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\n",
      "in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\n",
      "She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over\n",
      "unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\n",
      "disposition.\n",
      "Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\n",
      "father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\n",
      "united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\n",
      "every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\n",
      "of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\n",
      "She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at\n",
      "present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents\n",
      "stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\n",
      "and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\n",
      "saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\n",
      "officers at once.\n",
      "Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\n",
      "such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\n",
      "have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\n",
      "same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\n",
      "melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\n",
      "continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving\n",
      "home.\n",
      "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\n",
      "frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\n",
      "well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\n",
      "learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\n",
      "an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\n",
      "behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\n",
      "for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\n",
      "had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\n",
      "what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\n",
      "finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\n",
      "gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\n",
      "reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\n",
      "cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\n",
      "and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.\n",
      "On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,\n",
      "with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\n",
      "disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\n",
      "inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\n",
      "mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three\n",
      "weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\n",
      "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s\n",
      "recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\n",
      "him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\n",
      "asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\n",
      "With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you\n",
      "say that he was at Rosings?”\n",
      "“Nearly three weeks.”\n",
      "“And you saw him frequently?”\n",
      "“Yes, almost every day.”\n",
      "“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\n",
      "“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”\n",
      "“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray\n",
      "may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in\n",
      "address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\n",
      "ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more\n",
      "serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”\n",
      "“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\n",
      "what he ever was.”\n",
      "While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\n",
      "rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\n",
      "something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\n",
      "and anxious attention, while she added,--\n",
      "“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\n",
      "either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\n",
      "from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\n",
      "Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\n",
      "look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\n",
      "embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\n",
      "accents,--\n",
      "“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\n",
      "comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\n",
      "even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\n",
      "may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\n",
      "him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\n",
      "the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\n",
      "merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\n",
      "judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\n",
      "know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\n",
      "wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\n",
      "has very much at heart.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\n",
      "slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\n",
      "the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\n",
      "him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\n",
      "of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\n",
      "Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\n",
      "mutual desire of never meeting again.\n",
      "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\n",
      "from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\n",
      "between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\n",
      "only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\n",
      "and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\n",
      "opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there\n",
      "was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous\n",
      "happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\n",
      "of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLII.\n",
      "Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\n",
      "not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\n",
      "comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\n",
      "of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\n",
      "woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\n",
      "their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\n",
      "esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\n",
      "domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\n",
      "disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\n",
      "imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\n",
      "console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\n",
      "the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\n",
      "enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as\n",
      "her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\n",
      "the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\n",
      "wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\n",
      "philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\n",
      "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\n",
      "father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\n",
      "respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\n",
      "herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\n",
      "banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\n",
      "and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\n",
      "children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\n",
      "strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\n",
      "unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\n",
      "from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\n",
      "might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\n",
      "if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n",
      "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\n",
      "other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\n",
      "abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\n",
      "sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around\n",
      "them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\n",
      "might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\n",
      "of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\n",
      "greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\n",
      "folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\n",
      "watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\n",
      "has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\n",
      "forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\n",
      "satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\n",
      "name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\n",
      "some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\n",
      "again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\n",
      "present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\n",
      "was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\n",
      "for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\n",
      "and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\n",
      "scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n",
      "“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\n",
      "Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\n",
      "But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\n",
      "sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\n",
      "pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\n",
      "never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\n",
      "the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\n",
      "When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\n",
      "to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\n",
      "always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\n",
      "they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\n",
      "had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\n",
      "made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\n",
      "she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\n",
      "violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\n",
      "camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\n",
      "to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\n",
      "too full of lines under the words to be made public.\n",
      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\n",
      "good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\n",
      "wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\n",
      "came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\n",
      "of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\n",
      "without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\n",
      "hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\n",
      "reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\n",
      "some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\n",
      "should be quartered in Meryton.\n",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\n",
      "approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\n",
      "arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\n",
      "curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\n",
      "setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\n",
      "within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\n",
      "far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\n",
      "the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\n",
      "the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\n",
      "present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\n",
      "county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\n",
      "weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\n",
      "town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\n",
      "they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\n",
      "her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\n",
      "Dovedale, or the Peak.\n",
      "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\n",
      "the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\n",
      "was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\n",
      "and all was soon right again.\n",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\n",
      "impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\n",
      "owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\n",
      "and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\n",
      "The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\n",
      "before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\n",
      "Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\n",
      "younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\n",
      "Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\n",
      "sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\n",
      "way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\n",
      "morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\n",
      "enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\n",
      "suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\n",
      "inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\n",
      "and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\n",
      "disappointments abroad.\n",
      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\n",
      "nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\n",
      "lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\n",
      "sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\n",
      "concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\n",
      "former residence, and where she had lately learned that some\n",
      "acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\n",
      "all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\n",
      "Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\n",
      "was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\n",
      "talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\n",
      "inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\n",
      "willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n",
      "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\n",
      "much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\n",
      "acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\n",
      "Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\n",
      "must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\n",
      "she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\n",
      "richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\n",
      "grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\n",
      "possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\n",
      "occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\n",
      "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\n",
      "a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\n",
      "that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\n",
      "absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\n",
      "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",
      "whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\n",
      "proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\n",
      "the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\n",
      "alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\n",
      "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\n",
      "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\n",
      "with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\n",
      "to the scheme.\n",
      "To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLIII.\n",
      "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\n",
      "Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\n",
      "in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n",
      "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\n",
      "entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\n",
      "a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\n",
      "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\n",
      "half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\n",
      "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\n",
      "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\n",
      "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\n",
      "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\n",
      "woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\n",
      "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\n",
      "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\n",
      "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n",
      "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\n",
      "to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n",
      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\n",
      "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\n",
      "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\n",
      "mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\n",
      "hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\n",
      "wonder at her being where she was.\n",
      "The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\n",
      "fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\n",
      "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\n",
      "room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\n",
      "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\n",
      "which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\n",
      "distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\n",
      "good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\n",
      "on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\n",
      "it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\n",
      "taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\n",
      "to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\n",
      "suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\n",
      "admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\n",
      "fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\n",
      "furniture of Rosings.\n",
      "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\n",
      "these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\n",
      "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n",
      "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\n",
      "herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\n",
      "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\n",
      "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\n",
      "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\n",
      "absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\n",
      "asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\n",
      "party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\n",
      "not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n",
      "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\n",
      "the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\n",
      "miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\n",
      "she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\n",
      "picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\n",
      "had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\n",
      "army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\n",
      "return it.\n",
      "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n",
      "“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\n",
      "other--about eight years ago.”\n",
      "“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\n",
      "us whether it is like or not.”\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\n",
      "intimation of her knowing her master.\n",
      "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\n",
      "“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\n",
      "“Yes, very handsome.”\n",
      "“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\n",
      "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\n",
      "master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\n",
      "be then. He was very fond of them.”\n",
      "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\n",
      "when she was only eight years old.\n",
      "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\n",
      "“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\n",
      "accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\n",
      "new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\n",
      "comes here to-morrow with him.”\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\n",
      "communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\n",
      "from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\n",
      "master and his sister.\n",
      "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\n",
      "“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\n",
      "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\n",
      "“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\n",
      "“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\n",
      "“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\n",
      "good enough for him.”\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\n",
      "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\n",
      "“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\n",
      "him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\n",
      "and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n",
      "“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\n",
      "ever since he was four years old.”\n",
      "This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\n",
      "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\n",
      "Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\n",
      "grateful to her uncle for saying,--\n",
      "“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\n",
      "having such a master.”\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\n",
      "meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\n",
      "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\n",
      "was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\n",
      "world.”\n",
      "Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\n",
      "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\n",
      "as affable to the poor.”\n",
      "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\n",
      "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\n",
      "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\n",
      "furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n",
      "prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\n",
      "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\n",
      "many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n",
      "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\n",
      "lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\n",
      "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\n",
      "give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\n",
      "saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\n",
      "away like other young men.”\n",
      "“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\n",
      "“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\n",
      "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\n",
      "“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\n",
      "“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\n",
      "On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\n",
      "sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\n",
      "the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\n",
      "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\n",
      "last at Pemberley.\n",
      "“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\n",
      "one of the windows.\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\n",
      "the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\n",
      "can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\n",
      "is nothing he would not do for her.”\n",
      "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\n",
      "all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\n",
      "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n",
      "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n",
      "Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n",
      "also more intelligible.\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n",
      "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\n",
      "of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\n",
      "arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\n",
      "such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\n",
      "when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\n",
      "earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\n",
      "gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\n",
      "father’s lifetime.\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\n",
      "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\n",
      "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\n",
      "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n",
      "considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\n",
      "much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\n",
      "or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\n",
      "the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\n",
      "the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\n",
      "herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\n",
      "than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\n",
      "its impropriety of expression.\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n",
      "they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\n",
      "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\n",
      "As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n",
      "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\n",
      "conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n",
      "suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\n",
      "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\n",
      "instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\n",
      "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\n",
      "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n",
      "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n",
      "of perfect civility.\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n",
      "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
      "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n",
      "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n",
      "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\n",
      "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n",
      "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n",
      "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\n",
      "returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\n",
      "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\n",
      "uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
      "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\n",
      "minutes in which they continued together were some of the most\n",
      "uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\n",
      "spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\n",
      "inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\n",
      "in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n",
      "distraction of his thoughts.\n",
      "At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\n",
      "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n",
      "leave.\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\n",
      "figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\n",
      "feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\n",
      "vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\n",
      "thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\n",
      "disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\n",
      "she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\n",
      "or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\n",
      "only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\n",
      "discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\n",
      "moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\n",
      "again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\n",
      "strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\n",
      "her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\n",
      "family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\n",
      "never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n",
      "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\n",
      "he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\n",
      "account for it.\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n",
      "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n",
      "reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\n",
      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\n",
      "to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
      "was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n",
      "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\n",
      "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\n",
      "her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n",
      "composure.\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n",
      "roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
      "They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\n",
      "of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\n",
      "the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\n",
      "overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\n",
      "expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\n",
      "beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\n",
      "miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\n",
      "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\n",
      "hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\n",
      "the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\n",
      "the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n",
      "stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\n",
      "it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\n",
      "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\n",
      "returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\n",
      "about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\n",
      "quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\n",
      "sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\n",
      "met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\n",
      "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\n",
      "he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\n",
      "she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\n",
      "got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\n",
      "recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\n",
      "her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\n",
      "no more.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n",
      "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\n",
      "she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\n",
      "acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\n",
      "revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\n",
      "she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\n",
      "fashion.”\n",
      "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",
      "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n",
      "it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
      "connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\n",
      "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\n",
      "relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
      "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n",
      "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\n",
      "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n",
      "chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\n",
      "time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n",
      "walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\n",
      "wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\n",
      "compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\n",
      "extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\n",
      "what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\n",
      "work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n",
      "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\n",
      "brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n",
      "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n",
      "Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n",
      "her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n",
      "together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\n",
      "know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n",
      "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n",
      "very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n",
      "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\n",
      "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\n",
      "the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\n",
      "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n",
      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\n",
      "will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\n",
      "who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\n",
      "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\n",
      "between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\n",
      "not very differently engaged.\n",
      "“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\n",
      "pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\n",
      "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\n",
      "during your stay at Lambton?”\n",
      "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\n",
      "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\n",
      "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\n",
      "must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\n",
      "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\n",
      "him think really ill of her.\n",
      "They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\n",
      "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\n",
      "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\n",
      "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\n",
      "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\n",
      "mile behind.\n",
      "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\n",
      "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\n",
      "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\n",
      "there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\n",
      "she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\n",
      "great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\n",
      "and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\n",
      "On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\n",
      "the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\n",
      "parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\n",
      "ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n",
      "walking slowly towards the house.\n",
      "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\n",
      "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n",
      "“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\n",
      "“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\n",
      "aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\n",
      "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n",
      "_I_ have seen nothing of it.”\n",
      "“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\n",
      "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\n",
      "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\n",
      "“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\n",
      "or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\n",
      "perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\n",
      "disagreeable?”\n",
      "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\n",
      "him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\n",
      "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\n",
      "her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\n",
      "at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\n",
      "warn me off his grounds.”\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\n",
      "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\n",
      "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n",
      "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\n",
      "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\n",
      "good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\n",
      "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\n",
      "master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\n",
      "every virtue.”\n",
      "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\n",
      "his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\n",
      "guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\n",
      "relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
      "Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",
      "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\n",
      "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\n",
      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\n",
      "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\n",
      "no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n",
      "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\n",
      "intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\n",
      "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\n",
      "much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\n",
      "but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above\n",
      "all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLIV.\n",
      "Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\n",
      "her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,\n",
      "resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\n",
      "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\n",
      "arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the\n",
      "place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\n",
      "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\n",
      "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\n",
      "curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\n",
      "livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\n",
      "to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\n",
      "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\n",
      "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\n",
      "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\n",
      "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\n",
      "that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\n",
      "a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\n",
      "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\n",
      "Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\n",
      "at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\n",
      "dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\n",
      "her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\n",
      "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\n",
      "up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\n",
      "inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\n",
      "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\n",
      "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\n",
      "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\n",
      "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\n",
      "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\n",
      "her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\n",
      "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\n",
      "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\n",
      "was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n",
      "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\n",
      "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\n",
      "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",
      "They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\n",
      "also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\n",
      "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\n",
      "was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\n",
      "Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\n",
      "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\n",
      "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\n",
      "inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\n",
      "looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
      "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\n",
      "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\n",
      "them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\n",
      "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\n",
      "each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from\n",
      "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\n",
      "it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in\n",
      "doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\n",
      "evident enough.\n",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\n",
      "feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\n",
      "make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\n",
      "feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom\n",
      "she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.\n",
      "Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be\n",
      "pleased.\n",
      "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\n",
      "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a\n",
      "like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\n",
      "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\n",
      "that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\n",
      "though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\n",
      "behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No\n",
      "look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing\n",
      "occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On\n",
      "this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\n",
      "occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted\n",
      "a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\n",
      "saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He\n",
      "observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and\n",
      "in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long\n",
      "time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could\n",
      "reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the\n",
      "26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\n",
      "took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n",
      "_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\n",
      "nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\n",
      "gave them meaning.\n",
      "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but\n",
      "whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general\n",
      "complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\n",
      "removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\n",
      "that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\n",
      "however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\n",
      "day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the\n",
      "good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would\n",
      "have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,\n",
      "but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\n",
      "their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the\n",
      "change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could\n",
      "hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\n",
      "company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\n",
      "at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\n",
      "self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could\n",
      "result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n",
      "acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\n",
      "down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\n",
      "Rosings.\n",
      "Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose\n",
      "to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\n",
      "their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\n",
      "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\n",
      "diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\n",
      "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\n",
      "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\n",
      "acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\n",
      "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\n",
      "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\n",
      "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\n",
      "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\n",
      "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\n",
      "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\n",
      "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\n",
      "on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\n",
      "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\n",
      "satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\n",
      "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\n",
      "uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\n",
      "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
      "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\n",
      "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\n",
      "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\n",
      "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\n",
      "interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\n",
      "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\n",
      "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\n",
      "from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\n",
      "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\n",
      "would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n",
      "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\n",
      "that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\n",
      "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\n",
      "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\n",
      "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\n",
      "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\n",
      "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\n",
      "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\n",
      "was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\n",
      "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\n",
      "son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\n",
      "fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\n",
      "him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\n",
      "the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\n",
      "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\n",
      "she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\n",
      "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\n",
      "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\n",
      "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\n",
      "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\n",
      "time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\n",
      "into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\n",
      "favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\n",
      "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\n",
      "there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\n",
      "overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\n",
      "loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\n",
      "petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\n",
      "unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\n",
      "persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\n",
      "accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\n",
      "without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\n",
      "where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\n",
      "opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\n",
      "a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\n",
      "gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\n",
      "such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\n",
      "means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\n",
      "she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\n",
      "welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\n",
      "depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\n",
      "that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\n",
      "possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\n",
      "It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\n",
      "such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very\n",
      "day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\n",
      "breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\n",
      "some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\n",
      "would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\n",
      "morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\n",
      "she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\n",
      "renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\n",
      "some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLV.\n",
      "Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had\n",
      "originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\n",
      "her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\n",
      "with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now\n",
      "be renewed.\n",
      "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\n",
      "whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,\n",
      "opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\n",
      "hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\n",
      "which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n",
      "In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\n",
      "with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\n",
      "London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\n",
      "all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\n",
      "fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\n",
      "inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\n",
      "her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n",
      "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\n",
      "on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\n",
      "succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\n",
      "genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\n",
      "of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\n",
      "others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\n",
      "Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\n",
      "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\n",
      "short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\n",
      "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\n",
      "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\n",
      "from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\n",
      "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\n",
      "of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\n",
      "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\n",
      "feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\n",
      "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\n",
      "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\n",
      "Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\n",
      "inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\n",
      "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\n",
      "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\n",
      "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\n",
      "significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\n",
      "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\n",
      "party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\n",
      "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\n",
      "them round the table.\n",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\n",
      "she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\n",
      "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\n",
      "a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\n",
      "regret that he came.\n",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\n",
      "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\n",
      "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\n",
      "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\n",
      "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\n",
      "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\n",
      "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\n",
      "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\n",
      "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\n",
      "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\n",
      "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\n",
      "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\n",
      "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\n",
      "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\n",
      "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\n",
      "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\n",
      "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\n",
      "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n",
      "“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\n",
      "They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\n",
      "In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\n",
      "instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\n",
      "various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\n",
      "but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\n",
      "presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\n",
      "she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\n",
      "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\n",
      "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\n",
      "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\n",
      "refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\n",
      "Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\n",
      "her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\n",
      "Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\n",
      "and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\n",
      "that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\n",
      "meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\n",
      "was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\n",
      "her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\n",
      "which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\n",
      "hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\n",
      "meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\n",
      "Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\n",
      "for the welfare of his friend.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\n",
      "as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\n",
      "Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\n",
      "to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\n",
      "recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\n",
      "had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\n",
      "fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n",
      "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\n",
      "mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\n",
      "Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\n",
      "person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\n",
      "brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\n",
      "could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\n",
      "Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\n",
      "amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\n",
      "repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n",
      "“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\n",
      "never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\n",
      "She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\n",
      "should not have known her again.”\n",
      "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\n",
      "himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\n",
      "her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\n",
      "summer.\n",
      "“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\n",
      "any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\n",
      "brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\n",
      "character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\n",
      "tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\n",
      "have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\n",
      "extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\n",
      "like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\n",
      "without fashion, which is intolerable.”\n",
      "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\n",
      "the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\n",
      "wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\n",
      "success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\n",
      "determination of making him speak, she continued,--\n",
      "“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\n",
      "were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\n",
      "your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\n",
      "a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\n",
      "seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\n",
      "one time.”\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\n",
      "was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\n",
      "considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\n",
      "He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\n",
      "having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\n",
      "visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\n",
      "both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\n",
      "except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\n",
      "of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\n",
      "himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\n",
      "him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\n",
      "beginning the subject.\n",
      "Chapter XLVI.\n",
      "Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\n",
      "Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\n",
      "renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\n",
      "the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\n",
      "receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\n",
      "it had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\n",
      "Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\n",
      "They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\n",
      "uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\n",
      "themselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\n",
      "written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\n",
      "little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\n",
      "but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\n",
      "agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--\n",
      "“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\n",
      "most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\n",
      "assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\n",
      "An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\n",
      "from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\n",
      "with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\n",
      "surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\n",
      "very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\n",
      "to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\n",
      "Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\n",
      "let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\n",
      "disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\n",
      "Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\n",
      "thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\n",
      "him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\n",
      "twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\n",
      "eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\n",
      "passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\n",
      "him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\n",
      "their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\n",
      "mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\n",
      "know what I have written.”\n",
      "Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\n",
      "what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\n",
      "other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\n",
      "had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\n",
      "“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\n",
      "wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\n",
      "head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\n",
      "Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\n",
      "and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\n",
      "and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\n",
      "taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\n",
      "to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\n",
      "day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\n",
      "letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\n",
      "Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\n",
      "never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\n",
      "to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\n",
      "intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\n",
      "no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\n",
      "hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\n",
      "All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\n",
      "London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\n",
      "inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\n",
      "anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\n",
      "and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\n",
      "pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\n",
      "broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\n",
      "I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\n",
      "blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\n",
      "mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\n",
      "circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\n",
      "privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\n",
      "could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\n",
      "which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\n",
      "Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\n",
      "to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\n",
      "hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\n",
      "is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\n",
      "better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\n",
      "my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\n",
      "their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\n",
      "wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\n",
      "something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\n",
      "over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\n",
      "however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\n",
      "again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\n",
      "are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\n",
      "soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\n",
      "afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\n",
      "the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\n",
      "to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\n",
      "his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\n",
      "best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\n",
      "again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\n",
      "assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\n",
      "comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\n",
      "“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\n",
      "as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\n",
      "moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\n",
      "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\n",
      "impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\n",
      "enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\n",
      "situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\n",
      "I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\n",
      "I have not an instant to lose.”\n",
      "“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\n",
      "politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\n",
      "but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\n",
      "not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\n",
      "Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\n",
      "little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\n",
      "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\n",
      "accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\n",
      "mistress home instantly.\n",
      "On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\n",
      "looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\n",
      "or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n",
      "“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\n",
      "present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\n",
      "“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\n",
      "is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by\n",
      "some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\n",
      "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\n",
      "not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\n",
      "something indistinctly of his\n",
      "concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke\n",
      "again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It\n",
      "cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her\n",
      "friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\n",
      "Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too\n",
      "well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that\n",
      "can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”\n",
      "Darcy was fixed in astonishment.\n",
      "“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_\n",
      "might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained\n",
      "some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\n",
      "his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\n",
      "all too late now.”\n",
      "“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it\n",
      "certain, absolutely certain?”\n",
      "“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\n",
      "almost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to\n",
      "Scotland.”\n",
      "“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”\n",
      "“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s\n",
      "immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\n",
      "nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\n",
      "such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\n",
      "not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”\n",
      "Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n",
      "“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what\n",
      "I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\n",
      "much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\n",
      "Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\n",
      "and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\n",
      "gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\n",
      "was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\n",
      "weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\n",
      "wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\n",
      "consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\n",
      "was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\n",
      "wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\n",
      "him, as now, when all love must be vain.\n",
      "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\n",
      "humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up\n",
      "every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\n",
      "Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\n",
      "several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\n",
      "voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\n",
      "compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--\n",
      "“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything\n",
      "to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\n",
      "Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\n",
      "that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\n",
      "you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\n",
      "This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\n",
      "“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\n",
      "urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\n",
      "long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”\n",
      "He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\n",
      "her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\n",
      "reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\n",
      "only one serious parting look, went away.\n",
      "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\n",
      "should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\n",
      "marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\n",
      "retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\n",
      "contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\n",
      "feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\n",
      "formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n",
      "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\n",
      "change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\n",
      "otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\n",
      "unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\n",
      "first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\n",
      "exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\n",
      "somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\n",
      "and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\n",
      "less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\n",
      "with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\n",
      "produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\n",
      "business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\n",
      "hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\n",
      "could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\n",
      "of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\n",
      "letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\n",
      "that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\n",
      "for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\n",
      "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\n",
      "as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\n",
      "suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\n",
      "intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\n",
      "her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\n",
      "prey.\n",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\n",
      "Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\n",
      "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\n",
      "officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\n",
      "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\n",
      "fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\n",
      "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\n",
      "feel it!\n",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\n",
      "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\n",
      "family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\n",
      "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\n",
      "could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\n",
      "importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\n",
      "was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\n",
      "by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\n",
      "satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\n",
      "cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\n",
      "the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\n",
      "been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\n",
      "deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\n",
      "the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\n",
      "promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\n",
      "less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\n",
      "by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\n",
      "settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\n",
      "done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\n",
      "here when you sent for us;--was it so?”\n",
      "“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n",
      "_That_ is all settled.”\n",
      "“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\n",
      "prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\n",
      "truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\n",
      "But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\n",
      "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\n",
      "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\n",
      "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\n",
      "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\n",
      "be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\n",
      "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\n",
      "Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\n",
      "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\n",
      "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\n",
      "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLVII.\n",
      "“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\n",
      "drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\n",
      "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\n",
      "matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\n",
      "such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\n",
      "friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\n",
      "am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\n",
      "would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\n",
      "regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\n",
      "not adequate to the risk.”\n",
      "“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\n",
      "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\n",
      "interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\n",
      "Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\n",
      "him capable of it?”\n",
      "“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\n",
      "I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\n",
      "hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\n",
      "case?”\n",
      "“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\n",
      "that they are not gone to Scotland.”\n",
      "“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\n",
      "presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\n",
      "Barnet road.”\n",
      "“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\n",
      "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\n",
      "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\n",
      "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\n",
      "expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\n",
      "“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\n",
      "marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\n",
      "friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\n",
      "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\n",
      "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\n",
      "beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\n",
      "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\n",
      "restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\n",
      "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\n",
      "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n",
      "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\n",
      "brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\n",
      "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\n",
      "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\n",
      "do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\n",
      "such a matter.”\n",
      "“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\n",
      "as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”\n",
      "“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\n",
      "tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\n",
      "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\n",
      "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\n",
      "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\n",
      "nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n",
      "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\n",
      "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\n",
      "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\n",
      "flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\n",
      "everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\n",
      "greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\n",
      "are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\n",
      "charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\n",
      "“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\n",
      "Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\n",
      "“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\n",
      "their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\n",
      "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\n",
      "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\n",
      "sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\n",
      "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\n",
      "“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\n",
      "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n",
      "“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\n",
      "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\n",
      "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\n",
      "such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\n",
      "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\n",
      "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\n",
      "what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\n",
      "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\n",
      "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\n",
      "and Jane seem so well to understand?”\n",
      "“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\n",
      "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\n",
      "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\n",
      "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\n",
      "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\n",
      "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\n",
      "apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\n",
      "neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\n",
      "was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\n",
      "opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\n",
      "be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\n",
      "consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\n",
      "enough from my thoughts.”\n",
      "“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\n",
      "suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\n",
      "“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\n",
      "side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\n",
      "that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\n",
      "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\n",
      "were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\n",
      "the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\n",
      "attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\n",
      "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\n",
      "who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\n",
      "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\n",
      "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\n",
      "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\n",
      "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\n",
      "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\n",
      "find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n",
      "They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\n",
      "the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\n",
      "to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\n",
      "expectations.\n",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\n",
      "on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\n",
      "carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\n",
      "faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\n",
      "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n",
      "Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\n",
      "hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\n",
      "her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\n",
      "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\n",
      "eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\n",
      "heard of the fugitives.\n",
      "“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\n",
      "everything will be well.”\n",
      "“Is my father in town?”\n",
      "“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\n",
      "“And have you heard from him often?”\n",
      "“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\n",
      "that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\n",
      "particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\n",
      "again, till he had something of importance to mention.”\n",
      "“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\n",
      "“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\n",
      "shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\n",
      "all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\n",
      "Heaven! are quite well.”\n",
      "“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\n",
      "must have gone through!”\n",
      "Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\n",
      "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\n",
      "engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\n",
      "the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\n",
      "thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\n",
      "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\n",
      "had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\n",
      "found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\n",
      "however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\n",
      "deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\n",
      "every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\n",
      "to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\n",
      "conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\n",
      "tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\n",
      "conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\n",
      "blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\n",
      "errors of her daughter must be principally owing.\n",
      "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\n",
      "with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\n",
      "had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\n",
      "of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\n",
      "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\n",
      "been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\n",
      "the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\n",
      "child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\n",
      "Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\n",
      "to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\n",
      "in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\n",
      "we shall do.”\n",
      "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\n",
      "general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\n",
      "that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\n",
      "Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n",
      "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\n",
      "prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\n",
      "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\n",
      "may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\n",
      "and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\n",
      "lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\n",
      "come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\n",
      "together as to what is to be done.”\n",
      "“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\n",
      "could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\n",
      "wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\n",
      "marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\n",
      "tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\n",
      "after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\n",
      "fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\n",
      "out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\n",
      "such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\n",
      "heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\n",
      "Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\n",
      "for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\n",
      "kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\n",
      "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\n",
      "in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\n",
      "her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\n",
      "dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\n",
      "housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\n",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\n",
      "occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\n",
      "oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\n",
      "tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\n",
      "better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\n",
      "most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\n",
      "too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\n",
      "before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\n",
      "faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\n",
      "in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\n",
      "which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more\n",
      "of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\n",
      "mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\n",
      "of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--\n",
      "“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\n",
      "But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\n",
      "each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\n",
      "Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n",
      "“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\n",
      "lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one\n",
      "false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less\n",
      "brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in\n",
      "her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\n",
      "Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to\n",
      "make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\n",
      "kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\n",
      "In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\n",
      "hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\n",
      "opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to\n",
      "satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\n",
      "of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\n",
      "Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\n",
      "the subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I\n",
      "have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\n",
      "Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\n",
      "took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”\n",
      "“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\n",
      "especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\n",
      "grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n",
      "_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\n",
      "any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\n",
      "first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\n",
      "“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\n",
      "their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\n",
      "“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\n",
      "their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\n",
      "repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\n",
      "inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”\n",
      "“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\n",
      "doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\n",
      "“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a\n",
      "little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in\n",
      "marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\n",
      "right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\n",
      "imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\n",
      "triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\n",
      "she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\n",
      "being in love with each other many weeks.”\n",
      "“But not before they went to Brighton?”\n",
      "“No, I believe not.”\n",
      "“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\n",
      "know his real character?”\n",
      "“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\n",
      "did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\n",
      "affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\n",
      "but I hope this may be false.”\n",
      "“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\n",
      "this could not have happened!”\n",
      "“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\n",
      "“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\n",
      "their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”\n",
      "“We acted with the best intentions.”\n",
      "“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\n",
      "wife?”\n",
      "“He brought it with him for us to see.”\n",
      "Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\n",
      "were the contents:--\n",
      "     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */\n",
      "     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\n",

      "finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But\n",
      "at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\n",

      "did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\n",
      "“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\n",
      "very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to\n",
      "give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\n",
      "as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen\n",
      "almost took from me my faculties.”\n",
      "“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\n",

      "condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\n",
      "they could be of use to us.”\n",
      "“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she\n",
      "_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too\n",
      "little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,\n",
      "insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”\n",

      "intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\n",
      "“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where\n",
      "they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could\n",
      "be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\n",
      "number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\n",
      "with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\n",

      "They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to\n",

      "Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\n",
      "When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\n",

      "to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to\n",
      "the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\n",
      "security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\n",
      "days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to\n",
      "her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\n",
      "great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\n",
      "visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\n",
      "cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\n",
      "reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,\n",
      "she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\n",
      "them.\n",
      "All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\n",
      "before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\n",
      "to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\n",
      "the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.\n",
      "Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\n",
      "everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\n",
      "appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\n",
      "half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\n",

      "news of them.\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\n",
      "letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately\n",
      "found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.\n",
      "That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\n",
      "without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\n",

      "thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\n",
      "coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\n",
      "did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was\n",
      "eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.\n",
      "Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and\n",
      "promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this\n",
      "effect:--\n",
      "“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\n",
      "possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\n",
      "whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\n",
      "know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there\n",
      "were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such\n",
      "a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\n",
      "nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\n",
      "his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps\n",
      "Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any\n",
      "other person.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for\n",
      "her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\n",
      "information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\n",
      "She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\n",
      "and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,\n",
      "however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to\n",
      "give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\n",
      "it, the application was a something to look forward to.\n",
      "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\n",
      "part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was\n",
      "the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,\n",
      "whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every\n",
      "succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\n",
      "But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\n",
      "their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\n",
      "had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\n",
      "she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\n",
      "letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\n",
      "follows:--\n",
      "     /* “My dear Sir, */\n",
      "     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\n",
      "     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\n",
      "     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\n",
      "     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and\n",
      "     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable\n",
      "     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\n",
      "     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\n",
      "     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\n",
      "     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\n",
      "     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The\n",
      "     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\n",
      "     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\n",
      "     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n",
      "     of behaviour in your\n",
      "     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\n",
      "     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,\n",
      "     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\n",
      "     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\n",
      "     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in\n",
      "     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by\n",
      "     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\n",
      "     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one\n",
      "     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for\n",
      "     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect\n",
      "     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,\n",
      "     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\n",
      "     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\n",
      "     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,\n",
      "     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\n",
      "     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\n",
      "     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\n",
      "“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\n",
      "Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\n",
      "It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up\n",
      "any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His\n",
      "former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the\n",
      "militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\n",
      "with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out\n",
      "as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own\n",
      "finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\n",
      "his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired\n",
      "that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\n",
      "Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be\n",
      "necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the\n",
      "town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner\n",
      "did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;\n",
      "Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\n",
      "unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their\n",
      "father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\n",
      "spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\n",
      "his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and\n",
      "leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\n",
      "for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\n",
      "not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\n",
      "what her anxiety for his life had been before.\n",
      "“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he\n",
      "will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\n",
      "and make him marry her, if he comes away?”\n",
      "As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\n",
      "and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet\n",
      "came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\n",
      "journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\n",
      "Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.\n",
      "His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\n",
      "and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of\n",
      "their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\n",
      "Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from\n",
      "Pemberley.\n",
      "The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\n",
      "the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\n",
      "fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time\n",
      "tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\n",
      "that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\n",
      "Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\n",
      "one sleepless night out of two.\n",
      "When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\n",
      "philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\n",
      "habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\n",
      "away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\n",
      "Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\n",
      "expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\n",
      "nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\n",
      "and I ought to feel it.”\n",
      "“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\n",
      "“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to\n",
      "fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\n",
      "been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\n",
      "It will pass away soon enough.”\n",
      "“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\n",
      "“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\n",
      "“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\n",
      "“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there\n",
      "will probably be of some duration.”\n",
      "Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no\n",
      "ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,\n",
      "considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”\n",
      "They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s\n",
      "tea.\n",
      "“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an\n",
      "elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\n",
      "library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\n",
      "I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”\n",
      "“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_\n",
      "should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\n",
      "“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,\n",
      "for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and\n",
      "you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house\n",
      "again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely\n",
      "prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are\n",
      "never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten\n",
      "minutes of every day in a rational manner.”\n",
      "Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\n",
      "“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\n",
      "girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "CHAPTER XLIX.\n",
      "Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\n",
      "together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\n",
      "coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their\n",
      "mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,\n",
      "when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,\n",
      "madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\n",
      "good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”\n",
      "“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\n",
      "“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know\n",
      "there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\n",
      "this half hour, and master has had a letter.”\n",
      "Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\n",
      "ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\n",
      "library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\n",
      "seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the\n",
      "butler, who said,--\n",
      "“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the\n",
      "little copse.”\n",
      "Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,\n",
      "and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\n",
      "pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\n",
      "Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\n",
      "Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\n",
      "came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--\n",
      "“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”\n",
      "“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”\n",
      "“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”\n",
      "“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from\n",
      "his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”\n",
      "Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\n",

      "     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\n",
      "     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\n",
      "     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will\n",
      "     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\n",
      "     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\n",
      "     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\n",
      "     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,\n",
      "     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my\n",
      "     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\n",
      "     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\n",
      "     anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.\n",
      "“EDW. GARDINER.”\n",
      "“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be\n",
      "possible that he will marry her?”\n",
      "“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her\n",
      "sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\n",
      "“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "“No; but it must be done soon.”\n",
      "Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\n",
      "wrote.\n",
      "“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\n",
      "Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”\n",
      "“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\n",
      "And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\n",
      "“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be\n",
      "complied with.”\n",
      "“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\n",
      "“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”\n",
      "“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\n",
      "are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\n",
      "your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever\n",
      "to pay him.”\n",
      "“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\n",
      "“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight\n",
      "a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\n",
      "gone.”\n",
      "“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me\n",
      "before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,\n",
      "it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\n",
      "distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”\n",
      "“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\n",
      "less than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\n",
      "in the very beginning of our relationship.”\n",
      "“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\n",
      "repaid?”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued\n",
      "silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the\n",
      "library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\n",
      "“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\n",
      "were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be\n",
      "thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\n",
      "and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”\n",
      "“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would\n",
      "not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\n",
      "uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\n",
      "thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\n",
      "of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\n",
      "pounds?”\n",
      "“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said\n",
      "Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\n",
      "exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\n",
      "not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\n",
      "requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\n",
      "protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\n",
      "years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\n",
      "actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\n",
      "she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\n",
      "first sees my aunt!”\n",
      "“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said\n",
      "Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\n",
      "her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\n",
      "thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\n",
      "they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\n",
      "time make their past imprudence forgotten.”\n",
      "“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor\n",
      "I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”\n",
      "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\n",
      "perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\n",
      "therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\n",
      "it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly\n",
      "replied,--\n",
      "“Just as you please.”\n",
      "“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\n",
      "“Take whatever you like, and get away.”\n",
      "Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs\n",
      "together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\n",
      "would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\n",
      "the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\n",
      "soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,\n",
      "her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\n",
      "exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she\n",
      "had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\n",
      "would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\n",
      "felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n",
      "“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will\n",
      "be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My\n",
      "good, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\n",
      "everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\n",
      "clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\n",
      "them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\n",
      "much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\n",
      "Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\n",
      "Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”\n",
      "Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\n",
      "these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\n",
      "Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\n",
      "“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great\n",
      "measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\n",
      "assist Mr. Wickham with money.”\n",
      "“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\n",
      "her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\n",
      "must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\n",
      "ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\n",
      "In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\n",
      "it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\n",
      "such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\n",
      "write for me. We will settle with your father about the money\n",
      "afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\n",
      "She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\n",
      "cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\n",
      "not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\n",
      "father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,\n",
      "would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\n",
      "so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\n",
      "“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\n",
      "good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\n",
      "Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\n",
      "airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\n",
      "anything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\n",
      "heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\n",
      "all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”\n",
      "Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\n",
      "congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\n",
      "refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s\n",
      "situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she\n",
      "had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,\n",
      "neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly\n",
      "expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only\n",
      "two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\n",
      "CHAPTER L.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\n",
      "instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\n",
      "the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\n",
      "him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\n",
      "respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\n",
      "honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\n",
      "prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\n",
      "be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\n",
      "He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\n",
      "should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\n",
      "was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\n",
      "and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\n",
      "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\n",
      "useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\n",
      "in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\n",
      "and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\n",
      "successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\n",
      "would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\n",
      "late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\n",
      "husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\n",
      "income.\n",
      "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\n",
      "the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\n",
      "latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\n",
      "regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\n",
      "could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\n",
      "terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\n",
      "expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\n",
      "approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\n",
      "engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\n",
      "that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\n",
      "done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\n",
      "arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\n",
      "hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\n",
      "allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\n",
      "through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\n",
      "that sum.\n",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\n",
      "another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\n",
      "as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\n",
      "of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\n",
      "naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\n",
      "despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\n",
      "its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\n",
      "indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\n",
      "message to her.\n",
      "The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\n",
      "speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\n",
      "philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\n",
      "conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\n",
      "happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\n",
      "farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\n",
      "good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\n",
      "all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\n",
      "in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\n",
      "was considered certain.\n",
      "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\n",
      "happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\n",
      "spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\n",
      "triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\n",
      "her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\n",
      "accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\n",
      "attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\n",
      "servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\n",
      "proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\n",
      "what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\n",
      "great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\n",
      "too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\n",
      "Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\n",
      "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\n",
      "servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\n",
      "daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\n",
      "neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\n",
      "imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”\n",
      "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\n",
      "soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\n",
      "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\n",
      "daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\n",
      "affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\n",
      "it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\n",
      "resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\n",
      "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\n",
      "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\n",
      "clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\n",
      "shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\n",
      "took place.\n",
      "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\n",
      "the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\n",
      "her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\n",
      "termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\n",
      "unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\n",
      "spot.\n",
      "She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\n",
      "few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\n",
      "but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\n",
      "frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\n",
      "disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\n",
      "seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\n",
      "concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\n",
      "Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\n",
      "objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\n",
      "kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n",
      "From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\n",
      "wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\n",
      "feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\n",
      "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\n",
      "hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\n",
      "longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\n",
      "seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\n",
      "she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\n",
      "should meet.\n",
      "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\n",
      "proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\n",
      "have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\n",
      "doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\n",
      "there must be a triumph.\n",
      "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\n",
      "disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\n",
      "temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\n",
      "was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\n",
      "and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\n",
      "and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\n",
      "have received benefit of greater importance.\n",
      "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\n",
      "connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\n",
      "precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\n",
      "family.\n",
      "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\n",
      "could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\n",
      "a couple who were only brought together because their passions were\n",
      "stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\n",
      "acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\n",
      "promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\n",
      "that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\n",
      "purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\n",
      "on quitting the militia.\n",
      "“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his\n",
      "marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\n",
      "considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\n",
      "account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\n",
      "Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\n",
      "able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\n",
      "ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\n",
      "an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\n",
      "promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\n",
      "have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\n",
      "written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\n",
      "and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\n",
      "in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\n",
      "pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\n",
      "similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\n",
      "a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\n",
      "hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\n",
      "all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\n",
      "unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\n",
      "leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\n",
      "you and her mother.--Yours, etc.\n",
      "“E. GARDINER.”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\n",
      "removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\n",
      "the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\n",
      "company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\n",
      "Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\n",
      "pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\n",
      "with everybody, and had so many favourites.\n",
      "“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\n",
      "to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\n",
      "likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s\n",
      "regiment.”\n",
      "His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\n",
      "admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,\n",
      "received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who\n",
      "agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\n",
      "consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\n",
      "urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\n",
      "and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\n",
      "prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\n",
      "mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show\n",
      "her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to\n",
      "the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\n",
      "sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon\n",
      "as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth\n",
      "was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;\n",
      "and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\n",
      "would have been the last object of her wishes.\n",
      "CHAPTER LI.\n",
      "Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\n",
      "probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\n",
      "them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\n",
      "was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\n",
      "gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\n",
      "been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\n",
      "must endure.\n",
      "They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\n",
      "them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\n",
      "the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\n",
      "anxious, uneasy.\n",
      "Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\n",
      "she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\n",
      "welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\n",
      "Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\n",
      "alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.\n",
      "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\n",
      "so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\n",
      "opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\n",
      "enough to provoke him.\n",
      "Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\n",
      "Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\n",
      "from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\n",
      "length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\n",
      "some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\n",
      "great while since she had been there.\n",
      "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\n",
      "were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\n",
      "exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\n",
      "claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\n",
      "had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\n",
      "down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\n",
      "impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\n",
      "cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\n",
      "colour.\n",
      "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\n",
      "of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\n",
      "Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\n",
      "with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\n",
      "replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\n",
      "world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\n",
      "voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\n",
      "the world.\n",
      "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\n",
      "it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things\n",
      "enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\n",
      "I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\n",
      "thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\n",
      "Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\n",
      "expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\n",
      "which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\n",
      "“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was\n",
      "afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\n",
      "so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\n",
      "next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\n",
      "window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\n",
      "smiled like anything.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\n",
      "and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\n",
      "the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\n",
      "anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to\n",
      "her eldest sister,--\n",
      "“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a\n",
      "married woman.”\n",
      "It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\n",
      "from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\n",
      "spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\n",
      "their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\n",
      "each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\n",
      "and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n",
      "“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\n",
      "breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\n",
      "charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\n",
      "may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the\n",
      "place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\n",
      "“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\n",
      "at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\n",
      "“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\n",
      "You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\n",
      "Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\n",
      "will take care to get good partners for them all.”\n",
      "“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\n",
      "“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\n",
      "behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\n",
      "winter is over.”\n",
      "“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\n",
      "particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\n",
      "Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\n",
      "had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\n",
      "his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\n",
      "No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\n",
      "she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\n",
      "having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\n",
      "all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\n",
      "think than such as did not.\n",
      "Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\n",
      "find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her\n",
      "present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\n",
      "their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\n",
      "than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\n",
      "for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\n",
      "that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\n",
      "if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\n",
      "of having a companion.\n",
      "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\n",
      "occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\n",
      "everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\n",
      "on the first of September than anybody else in the country.\n",
      "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\n",
      "elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--\n",
      "“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\n",
      "not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\n",
      "curious to hear how it was managed?”\n",
      "“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\n",
      "said on the subject.”\n",
      "“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\n",
      "married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\n",
      "that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\n",
      "o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\n",
      "were to meet us at the church.\n",
      "“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\n",
      "you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\n",
      "have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\n",
      "dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\n",
      "sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\n",
      "thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\n",
      "he would be married in his blue coat.\n",
      "“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\n",
      "be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\n",
      "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\n",
      "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\n",
      "fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\n",
      "rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\n",
      "“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\n",
      "called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\n",
      "know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\n",
      "frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\n",
      "and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\n",
      "luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\n",
      "out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\n",
      "going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n",
      "“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\n",
      "I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\n",
      "them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\n",
      "“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\n",
      "subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\n",
      "“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\n",
      "ask you no questions.”\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\n",
      "all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”\n",
      "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\n",
      "power, by running away.\n",
      "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\n",
      "was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\n",
      "sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\n",
      "where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\n",
      "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\n",
      "brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\n",
      "placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\n",
      "could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\n",
      "wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\n",
      "Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\n",
      "intended.\n",
      "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\n",
      "know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\n",
      "speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\n",
      "a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\n",
      "for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\n",
      "think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\n",
      "ignorance.”\n",
      "“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the\n",
      "letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\n",
      "manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\n",
      "Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\n",
      "it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\n",
      "satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\n",
      "CHAPTER LII.\n",
      "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\n",
      "soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than\n",
      "hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\n",
      "interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\n",
      "happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\n",
      "contain a denial.\n",
      "     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */\n",
      "“My dear Niece,\n",
      "     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\n",
      "     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\n",
      "     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\n",
      "     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\n",
      "     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n",
      "     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\n",
      "     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n",
      "     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing\n",
      "     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\n",
      "     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\n",
      "     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n",
      "     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n",
      "     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n",
      "     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n",
      "     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\n",
      "     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\n",
      "     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\n",
      "     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\n",
      "     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n",
      "     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n",
      "     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\n",
      "     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\n",
      "     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\n",
      "     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\n",
      "     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\n",
      "     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n",
      "     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\n",
      "     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n",
      "     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\n",
      "     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n",
      "     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\n",
      "     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n",
      "     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n",
      "     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n",
      "     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\n",
      "     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n",
      "     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n",
      "     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n",
      "     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n",
      "     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n",
      "     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n",
      "     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\n",
      "     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n",
      "     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n",
      "     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n",
      "     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n",
      "     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n",
      "     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n",
      "     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n",
      "     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n",
      "     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n",
      "     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\n",
      "     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n",
      "     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n",
      "     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n",
      "     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n",
      "     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n",
      "     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\n",
      "     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\n",
      "     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\n",
      "     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\n",
      "     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\n",
      "     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\n",
      "     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\n",
      "     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\n",
      "     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\n",
      "     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\n",
      "     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\n",
      "     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\n",
      "     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\n",
      "     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\n",
      "     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\n",
      "     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\n",
      "     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\n",
      "     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n",
      "     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\n",
      "     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\n",
      "     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\n",
      "     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\n",
      "     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\n",
      "     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n",
      "     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\n",
      "     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n",
      "     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\n",
      "     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\n",
      "     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\n",
      "     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\n",
      "     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\n",
      "     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\n",
      "     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\n",
      "     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\n",
      "     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\n",
      "     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\n",
      "     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\n",
      "     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\n",
      "     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\n",
      "     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\n",
      "     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n",
      "     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\n",
      "     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n",
      "     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\n",
      "     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\n",
      "     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\n",
      "     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n",
      "     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n",
      "     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n",
      "     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n",
      "     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\n",
      "     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n",
      "     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n",
      "     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\n",
      "     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n",
      "     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\n",
      "     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n",
      "     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n",
      "     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n",
      "     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n",
      "     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n",
      "     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\n",
      "     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n",
      "     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n",
      "     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n",
      "     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n",
      "     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n",
      "     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\n",
      "     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n",
      "     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\n",
      "     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n",
      "     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\n",
      "     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\n",
      "     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\n",
      "     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n",
      "     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\n",
      "     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He\n",
      "     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\n",
      "     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n",
      "     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n",
      "     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\n",
      "     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n",
      "     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n",
      "     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n",
      "     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\n",
      "     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\n",
      "     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n",
      "     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n",
      "     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\n",
      "     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The\n",
      "     children have been wanting me this half hour.\n",
      "“Yours, very sincerely,\n",
      "“M. GARDINER.”\n",
      "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\n",
      "in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\n",
      "greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\n",
      "produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\n",
      "sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of\n",
      "goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\n",
      "just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\n",
      "extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\n",
      "on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\n",
      "research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\n",
      "must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\n",
      "meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\n",
      "most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\n",
      "pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\n",
      "nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\n",
      "was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\n",
      "that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\n",
      "affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\n",
      "overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\n",
      "Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\n",
      "the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\n",
      "how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\n",
      "extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\n",
      "he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\n",
      "it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\n",
      "she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\n",
      "assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\n",
      "materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\n",
      "they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\n",
      "return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\n",
      "him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\n",
      "had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\n",
      "him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that\n",
      "in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\n",
      "of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\n",
      "again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\n",
      "of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\n",
      "both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\n",
      "subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n",
      "She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;\n",
      "and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by\n",
      "Wickham.\n",
      "“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,\n",
      "as he joined her.\n",
      "“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow\n",
      "that the interruption must be unwelcome.”\n",
      "“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,\n",
      "and now we are better.”\n",
      "“True. Are the others coming out?”\n",
      "“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\n",
      "Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\n",
      "you have actually seen Pemberley.”\n",
      "She replied in the affirmative.\n",
      "“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\n",
      "for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\n",
      "old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\n",
      "me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\n",
      "“Yes, she did.”\n",
      "“And what did she say?”\n",
      "“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\n",
      "out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\n",
      "misrepresented.”\n",
      "“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\n",
      "silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--\n",
      "“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\n",
      "several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\n",
      "“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\n",
      "Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\n",
      "time of year.”\n",
      "“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\n",
      "understood from the Gardiners that you had.”\n",
      "“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\n",
      "“And do you like her?”\n",
      "“Very much.”\n",
      "“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\n",
      "or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\n",
      "you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”\n",
      "“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\n",
      "“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\n",
      "“I do not recollect that we did.”\n",
      "“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most\n",
      "delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in\n",
      "every respect.”\n",
      "“How should you have liked making sermons?”\n",
      "“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\n",
      "the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,\n",
      "to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the\n",
      "retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of\n",
      "happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\n",
      "circumstance when you were in Kent?”\n",
      "“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\n",
      "left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\n",
      "“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\n",
      "first, you may remember.”\n",
      "“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so\n",
      "palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\n",
      "declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\n",
      "had been compromised accordingly.”\n",
      "“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\n",
      "what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”\n",
      "They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\n",
      "to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,\n",
      "she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--\n",
      "“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\n",
      "quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\n",
      "mind.”\n",
      "She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\n",
      "he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\n",
      "CHAPTER LIII.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\n",
      "never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\n",
      "by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\n",
      "had said enough to keep him quiet.\n",
      "The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\n",
      "forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\n",
      "entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\n",
      "continue at least a twelvemonth.\n",
      "“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\n",
      "“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\n",
      "“Write to me very often, my dear.”\n",
      "“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\n",
      "writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\n",
      "smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\n",
      "“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\n",
      "the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\n",
      "all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\n",
      "himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\n",
      "The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\n",
      "“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\n",
      "one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”\n",
      "“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\n",
      "Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\n",
      "single.”\n",
      "“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\n",
      "but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\n",
      "that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\n",
      "But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\n",
      "relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\n",
      "article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\n",
      "at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\n",
      "master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\n",
      "weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\n",
      "smiled, and shook her head, by turns.\n",
      "“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\n",
      "Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that\n",
      "I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\n",
      "never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\n",
      "Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\n",
      "is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\n",
      "a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”\n",
      "“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\n",
      "Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\n",
      "to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\n",
      "comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\n",
      "going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\n",
      "Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\n",
      "Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\n",
      "colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\n",
      "Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--\n",
      "“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\n",
      "report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\n",
      "any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\n",
      "I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\n",
      "me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\n",
      "alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n",
      "_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”\n",
      "Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\n",
      "Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\n",
      "other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\n",
      "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\n",
      "there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\n",
      "without it.\n",
      "“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\n",
      "to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\n",
      "speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\n",
      "In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\n",
      "feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\n",
      "perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\n",
      "more unequal, than she had often seen them.\n",
      "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\n",
      "about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n",
      "“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\n",
      "will wait on him, of course.”\n",
      "“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\n",
      "went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\n",
      "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\n",
      "His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\n",
      "would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\n",
      "Netherfield.\n",
      "“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\n",
      "him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\n",
      "running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\n",
      "on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\n",
      "am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\n",
      "make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\n",
      "husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\n",
      "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n",
      "_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\n",
      "“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\n",
      "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\n",
      "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\n",
      "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\n",
      "says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\n",
      "“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\n",
      "is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\n",
      "of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\n",
      "always so much.”\n",
      "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\n",
      "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\n",
      "and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\n",
      "that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\n",
      "seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\n",
      "Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\n",
      "paddock, and ride towards the house.\n",
      "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\n",
      "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\n",
      "to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\n",
      "again by her sister.\n",
      "“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\n",
      "“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\n",
      "him before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”\n",
      "“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\n",
      "Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\n",
      "say that I hate the very sight of him.”\n",
      "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\n",
      "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\n",
      "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\n",
      "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\n",
      "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n",
      "mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\n",
      "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\n",
      "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\n",
      "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\n",
      "him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\n",
      "and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\n",
      "information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\n",
      "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n",
      "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\n",
      "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\n",
      "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\n",
      "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\n",
      "behaviour in Derbyshire.\n",
      "The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\n",
      "minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\n",
      "her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\n",
      "wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.\n",
      "“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\n",
      "enough for expectation.”\n",
      "She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\n",
      "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\n",
      "sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\n",
      "paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\n",
      "gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\n",
      "tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n",
      "symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\n",
      "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\n",
      "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\n",
      "had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\n",
      "she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\n",
      "she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\n",
      "mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\n",
      "painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\n",
      "Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\n",
      "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\n",
      "especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\n",
      "her courtesy and address of his friend.\n",
      "Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\n",
      "preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\n",
      "hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\n",
      "applied.\n",
      "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\n",
      "which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\n",
      "was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\n",
      "it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\n",
      "when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\n",
      "bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\n",
      "the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\n",
      "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\n",
      "the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\n",
      "they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\n",
      "with herself for being so.\n",
      "“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\n",
      "She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\n",
      "him she had hardly courage to speak.\n",
      "She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n",
      "“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "He readily agreed to it.\n",
      "“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\n",
      "you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\n",
      "it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\n",
      "since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\n",
      "own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\n",
      "seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\n",
      "though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\n",
      "George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\n",
      "syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\n",
      "It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\n",
      "to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\n",
      "Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\n",
      "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\n",
      "not tell.\n",
      "“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\n",
      "continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\n",
      "hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\n",
      "place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\n",
      "know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\n",
      "his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\n",
      "Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\n",
      "deserves.”\n",
      "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\n",
      "of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\n",
      "the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\n",
      "before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\n",
      "country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n",
      "“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\n",
      "“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\n",
      "Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\n",
      "will save all the best of the coveys for you.”\n",
      "Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\n",
      "attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\n",
      "flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\n",
      "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\n",
      "that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\n",
      "moments of such painful confusion.\n",
      "“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\n",
      "in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\n",
      "that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\n",
      "one or the other again!”\n",
      "Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\n",
      "compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\n",
      "how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\n",
      "lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\n",
      "five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\n",
      "as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\n",
      "unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\n",
      "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\n",
      "that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\n",
      "that she did not always know when she was silent.\n",
      "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\n",
      "intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\n",
      "Longbourn in a few days’ time.\n",
      "“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\n",
      "you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\n",
      "us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you\n",
      "I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\n",
      "engagement.”\n",
      "Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\n",
      "his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\n",
      "there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\n",
      "not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\n",
      "on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\n",
      "of one who had ten thousand a year.\n",
      "CHAPTER LIV.\n",
      "As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\n",
      "or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\n",
      "which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\n",
      "her.\n",
      "“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\n",
      "“did he come at all?”\n",
      "She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n",
      "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\n",
      "was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\n",
      "no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\n",
      "no more about him.”\n",
      "Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\n",
      "of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\n",
      "better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\n",
      "“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\n",
      "easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\n",
      "his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\n",
      "seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\n",
      "acquaintance.”\n",
      "“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\n",
      "take care.”\n",
      "“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”\n",
      "“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\n",
      "you as ever.”\n",
      "They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\n",
      "the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\n",
      "good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\n",
      "had revived.\n",
      "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\n",
      "who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\n",
      "sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\n",
      "dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\n",
      "the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\n",
      "her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\n",
      "invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\n",
      "hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\n",
      "decided. He placed himself by her.\n",
      "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\n",
      "bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\n",
      "Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\n",
      "likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\n",
      "alarm.\n",
      "His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\n",
      "admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\n",
      "Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\n",
      "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\n",
      "consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\n",
      "gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\n",
      "no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\n",
      "could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\n",
      "such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\n",
      "advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\n",
      "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\n",
      "cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\n",
      "made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\n",
      "and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\n",
      "him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\n",
      "the family.\n",
      "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\n",
      "bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\n",
      "without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\n",
      "than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\n",
      "uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\n",
      "came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\n",
      "She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\n",
      "chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n",
      "“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\n",
      "ever.”\n",
      "The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\n",
      "answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\n",
      "where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\n",
      "in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\n",
      "which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\n",
      "the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--\n",
      "“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\n",
      "do we?”\n",
      "Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\n",
      "her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\n",
      "to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\n",
      "being so silly!\n",
      "“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\n",
      "expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\n",
      "protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\n",
      "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”\n",
      "She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\n",
      "himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\n",
      "“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\n",
      "“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”\n",
      "“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\n",
      "“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\n",
      "these three weeks.”\n",
      "She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\n",
      "with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\n",
      "some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\n",
      "to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n",
      "When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\n",
      "all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\n",
      "all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\n",
      "mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\n",
      "with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\n",
      "They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\n",
      "nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\n",
      "of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\n",
      "supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\n",
      "others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\n",
      "“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\n",
      "say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\n",
      "assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\n",
      "venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\n",
      "a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\n",
      "Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\n",
      "were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\n",
      "cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\n",
      "beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\n",
      "what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\n",
      "at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\n",
      "good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\n",
      "girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\n",
      "Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\n",
      "last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\n",
      "humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\n",
      "not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n",
      "“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The\n",
      "party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\n",
      "may often meet again.”\n",
      "Elizabeth smiled.\n",
      "“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\n",
      "assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\n",
      "agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\n",
      "perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\n",
      "any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\n",
      "greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\n",
      "pleasing, than any other man.”\n",
      "“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\n",
      "are provoking me to it every moment.”\n",
      "“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\n",
      "others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\n",
      "acknowledge?”\n",
      "“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\n",
      "instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\n",
      "me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\n",
      "confidante.”\n",
      "CHAPTER LV.\n",
      "A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\n",
      "friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\n",
      "ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\n",
      "good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\n",
      "expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n",
      "“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\n",
      "He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\n",
      "would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\n",
      "them.\n",
      "“Can you come to-morrow?”\n",
      "Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\n",
      "accepted with alacrity.\n",
      "He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\n",
      "dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\n",
      "dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\n",
      "“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\n",
      "come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\n",
      "Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\n",
      "Lizzy’s hair.”\n",
      "“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\n",
      "forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\n",
      "“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\n",
      "where is your sash, my dear?”\n",
      "But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\n",
      "without one of her sisters.\n",
      "The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\n",
      "evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\n",
      "custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\n",
      "five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\n",
      "Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\n",
      "impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\n",
      "Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\n",
      "you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\n",
      "“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\n",
      "five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\n",
      "suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\n",
      "“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\n",
      "Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\n",
      "premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\n",
      "few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\n",
      "“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was forced to go.\n",
      "“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\n",
      "soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\n",
      "my dressing-room.”\n",
      "Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\n",
      "quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\n",
      "into the drawing-room.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\n",
      "everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\n",
      "daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\n",
      "addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\n",
      "officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\n",
      "forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\n",
      "an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\n",
      "means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\n",
      "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\n",
      "between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\n",
      "happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\n",
      "returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\n",
      "persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\n",
      "concurrence.\n",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\n",
      "morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\n",
      "agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\n",
      "or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\n",
      "silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\n",
      "other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\n",
      "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\n",
      "everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\n",
      "write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\n",
      "as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\n",
      "wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\n",
      "But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\n",
      "she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\n",
      "mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\n",
      "perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\n",
      "if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\n",
      "the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\n",
      "other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\n",
      "_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\n",
      "either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\n",
      "Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\n",
      "whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n",
      "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\n",
      "pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\n",
      "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n",
      "“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\n",
      "why is not everybody as happy?”\n",
      "Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\n",
      "delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\n",
      "kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\n",
      "allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\n",
      "said, for the present.\n",
      "“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\n",
      "account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\n",
      "from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\n",
      "know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\n",
      "family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\n",
      "She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\n",
      "card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.\n",
      "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\n",
      "with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\n",
      "previous months of suspense and vexation.\n",
      "“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\n",
      "circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\n",
      "happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\n",
      "In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\n",
      "father had been short and to the purpose.\n",
      "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n",
      "“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\n",
      "He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\n",
      "and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\n",
      "delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\n",
      "great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\n",
      "to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\n",
      "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\n",
      "expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\n",
      "basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\n",
      "Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\n",
      "Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\n",
      "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\n",
      "her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\n",
      "speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\n",
      "though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\n",
      "Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\n",
      "how really happy he was.\n",
      "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\n",
      "visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\n",
      "turned to his daughter and said,--\n",
      "“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\n",
      "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\n",
      "goodness.\n",
      "“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\n",
      "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\n",
      "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\n",
      "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\n",
      "easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\n",
      "always exceed your income.”\n",
      "“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\n",
      "unpardonable in _me_.”\n",
      "“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\n",
      "talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\n",
      "more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\n",
      "happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\n",
      "would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\n",
      "be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\n",
      "he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\n",
      "that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\n",
      "ever was seen!”\n",
      "Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\n",
      "favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\n",
      "sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\n",
      "which she might in future be able to dispense.\n",
      "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\n",
      "begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n",
      "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\n",
      "coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\n",
      "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\n",
      "detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\n",
      "himself obliged to accept.\n",
      "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\n",
      "while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\n",
      "she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\n",
      "separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\n",
      "attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\n",
      "when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\n",
      "“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\n",
      "was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\n",
      "it possible.”\n",
      "“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\n",
      "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\n",
      "chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\n",
      "as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\n",
      "learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\n",
      "can never be what we once were to each other.”\n",
      "“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\n",
      "heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\n",
      "the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\n",
      "“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\n",
      "really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\n",
      "would have prevented his coming down again?”\n",
      "“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\n",
      "modesty.”\n",
      "This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\n",
      "the little value he put on his own good qualities.\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\n",
      "of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\n",
      "heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\n",
      "her against him.\n",
      "“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\n",
      "Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\n",
      "above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\n",
      "another man for you!”\n",
      "“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\n",
      "Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\n",
      "happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\n",
      "good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\n",
      "The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\n",
      "secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\n",
      "she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\n",
      "neighbours in Meryton.\n",
      "The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\n",
      "world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\n",
      "they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\n",
      "CHAPTER LVI.\n",
      "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\n",
      "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\n",
      "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\n",
      "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\n",
      "lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\n",
      "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\n",
      "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\n",
      "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\n",
      "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\n",
      "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n",
      "shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\n",
      "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\n",
      "open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n",
      "They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\n",
      "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\n",
      "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\n",
      "other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\n",
      "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\n",
      "name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\n",
      "introduction had been made.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\n",
      "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\n",
      "for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\n",
      "“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\n",
      "mother?”\n",
      "Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n",
      "“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”\n",
      "“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n",
      "“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\n",
      "and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\n",
      "who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\n",
      "“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\n",
      "short silence.\n",
      "“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\n",
      "assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\n",
      "“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\n",
      "summer: the windows are full west.”\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\n",
      "added,--\n",
      "“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Collins well?”\n",
      "“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\n",
      "Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\n",
      "Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\n",
      "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\n",
      "refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\n",
      "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\n",
      "on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\n",
      "will favour me with your company.”\n",
      "“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\n",
      "different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\n",
      "Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\n",
      "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\n",
      "Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\n",
      "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\n",
      "decent-looking rooms, walked on.\n",
      "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\n",
      "waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\n",
      "that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\n",
      "conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\n",
      "disagreeable.\n",
      "“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\n",
      "her face.\n",
      "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\n",
      "manner:--\n",
      "“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\n",
      "journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\n",
      "come.”\n",
      "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n",
      "“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\n",
      "for the honour of seeing you here.”\n",
      "“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to\n",
      "know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\n",
      "choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\n",
      "celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\n",
      "moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\n",
      "alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\n",
      "sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n",
      "_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\n",
      "afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n",
      "_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\n",
      "so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\n",
      "setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\n",
      "with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\n",
      "so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”\n",
      "“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\n",
      "“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\n",
      "coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\n",
      "is in existence.”\n",
      "“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\n",
      "industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\n",
      "report is spread abroad?”\n",
      "“I never heard that it was.”\n",
      "“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”\n",
      "“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\n",
      "may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\n",
      "“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\n",
      "he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\n",
      "“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\n",
      "“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\n",
      "reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\n",
      "have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\n",
      "may have drawn him in.”\n",
      "“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\n",
      "language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\n",
      "and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\n",
      "“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\n",
      "this ever induce me to be explicit.”\n",
      "“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\n",
      "presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\n",
      "engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”\n",
      "“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\n",
      "make an offer to me.”\n",
      "Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--\n",
      "“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\n",
      "they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n",
      "_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the\n",
      "union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\n",
      "accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of\n",
      "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n",
      "the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\n",
      "tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\n",
      "propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\n",
      "earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\n",
      "“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\n",
      "other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\n",
      "kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\n",
      "Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\n",
      "marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\n",
      "honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\n",
      "another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\n",
      "“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss\n",
      "Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\n",
      "friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\n",
      "be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\n",
      "Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\n",
      "by any of us.”\n",
      "“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.\n",
      "Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\n",
      "attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\n",
      "to repine.”\n",
      "“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\n",
      "for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\n",
      "score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\n",
      "here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I\n",
      "be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s\n",
      "whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\n",
      "“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;\n",
      "but it will have no effect on _me_.”\n",
      "“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\n",
      "nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\n",
      "side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,\n",
      "honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on\n",
      "both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\n",
      "every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\n",
      "them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\n",
      "connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\n",
      "not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\n",
      "quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\n",
      "“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\n",
      "sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are\n",
      "equal.”\n",
      "“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who\n",
      "are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\n",
      "condition.”\n",
      "“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does\n",
      "not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\n",
      "“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\n",
      "Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\n",
      "Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\n",
      "moment’s deliberation,--\n",
      "“I am not.”\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\n",
      "“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\n",
      "“I will make no promise of the kind.”\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\n",
      "reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\n",
      "will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\n",
      "assurance I require.”\n",
      "“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\n",
      "anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\n",
      "your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\n",
      "_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\n",
      "me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\n",
      "his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\n",
      "which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\n",
      "frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\n",
      "character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\n",
      "How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\n",
      "I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\n",
      "mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the\n",
      "subject.”\n",
      "“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\n",
      "objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no\n",
      "stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\n",
      "elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\n",
      "patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\n",
      "_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\n",
      "of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of\n",
      "what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\n",
      "“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\n",
      "“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\n",
      "the house.”\n",
      "And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\n",
      "back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.\n",
      "“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\n",
      "Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\n",
      "must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\n",
      "“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”\n",
      "“You are then resolved to have him?”\n",
      "“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\n",
      "which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\n",
      "reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”\n",
      "“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\n",
      "claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\n",
      "the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”\n",
      "“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\n",
      "possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\n",
      "would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\n",
      "resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n",
      "_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\n",
      "concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\n",
      "the scorn.”\n",
      "“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\n",
      "shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\n",
      "ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\n",
      "reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”\n",
      "In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of\n",
      "the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--\n",
      "“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\n",
      "mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\n",
      "Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\n",
      "heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother\n",
      "impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady\n",
      "Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n",
      "“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”\n",
      "“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\n",
      "civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\n",
      "She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through\n",
      "Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\n",
      "nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\n",
      "Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to\n",
      "acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\n",
      "CHAPTER LVII.\n",
      "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\n",
      "Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\n",
      "hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\n",
      "appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\n",
      "for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\n",
      "Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\n",
      "their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\n",
      "till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\n",
      "and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\n",
      "expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\n",
      "the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\n",
      "sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\n",
      "Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\n",
      "Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\n",
      "only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\n",
      "looked forward to as possible at some future time.\n",
      "In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\n",
      "feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\n",
      "in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\n",
      "prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\n",
      "application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\n",
      "representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\n",
      "not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\n",
      "aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\n",
      "that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\n",
      "was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\n",
      "whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\n",
      "address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\n",
      "probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\n",
      "and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n",
      "If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\n",
      "seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\n",
      "settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\n",
      "unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\n",
      "Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\n",
      "Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n",
      "“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\n",
      "friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand\n",
      "it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\n",
      "constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\n",
      "have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\n",
      "at all.”\n",
      "The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\n",
      "been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same\n",
      "kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\n",
      "Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\n",
      "The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\n",
      "father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”\n",
      "She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\n",
      "her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\n",
      "connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\n",
      "be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\n",
      "consequent explanations.\n",
      "She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\n",
      "then said,--\n",
      "“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\n",
      "exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\n",
      "contents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\n",
      "of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\n",
      "The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\n",
      "conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\n",
      "and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\n",
      "himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\n",
      "herself, when her father continued,--\n",
      "“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\n",
      "as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the\n",
      "name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\n",
      "“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”\n",
      "“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with\n",
      "congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\n",
      "which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\n",
      "Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says\n",
      "on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus\n",
      "offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\n",
      "this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\n",
      "of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\n",
      "Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\n",
      "her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\n",
      "may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\n",
      "in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\n",
      "‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\n",
      "heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\n",
      "extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\n",
      "my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\n",
      "precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,\n",
      "you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,\n",
      "Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for\n",
      "cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\n",
      "Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\n",
      "eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\n",
      "surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\n",
      "the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\n",
      "effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\n",
      "woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\n",
      "his life! It is admirable!”\n",
      "Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force\n",
      "one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\n",
      "little agreeable to her.\n",
      "“Are you not diverted?”\n",
      "“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”\n",
      "“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\n",
      "night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\n",
      "felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\n",
      "some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\n",
      "her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\n",
      "duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\n",
      "and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\n",
      "hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.\n",
      "Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad\n",
      "business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\n",
      "living together before the marriage took place should be so generally\n",
      "known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\n",
      "from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\n",
      "couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\n",
      "encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\n",
      "very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\n",
      "a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\n",
      "names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\n",
      "Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\n",
      "Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\n",
      "Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\n",
      "_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\n",
      "what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\n",
      "in our turn?”\n",
      "“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\n",
      "strange!”\n",
      "“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\n",
      "it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_\n",
      "pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\n",
      "writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any\n",
      "consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\n",
      "him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\n",
      "hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\n",
      "about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\n",
      "To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\n",
      "been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\n",
      "repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\n",
      "feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\n",
      "would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by\n",
      "what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but\n",
      "wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of\n",
      "his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\n",
      "CHAPTER LVIII.\n",
      "Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\n",
      "Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\n",
      "with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s\n",
      "visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\n",
      "tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\n",
      "momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\n",
      "their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\n",
      "habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\n",
      "set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\n",
      "outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\n",
      "were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\n",
      "too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\n",
      "desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.\n",
      "They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon\n",
      "Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\n",
      "when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\n",
      "moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was\n",
      "high, she immediately said,--\n",
      "“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving\n",
      "relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\n",
      "can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\n",
      "sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to\n",
      "acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\n",
      "of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”\n",
      "“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\n",
      "and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\n",
      "mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\n",
      "was so little to be trusted.”\n",
      "“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\n",
      "me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\n",
      "not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\n",
      "in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\n",
      "you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\n",
      "sake of discovering them.”\n",
      "“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.\n",
      "That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\n",
      "inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\n",
      "_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\n",
      "only of _you_.”\n",
      "Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\n",
      "her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\n",
      "feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\n",
      "affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence\n",
      "me on this subject for ever.”\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\n",
      "his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\n",
      "very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\n",
      "so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\n",
      "her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\n",
      "happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\n",
      "felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\n",
      "warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\n",
      "been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\n",
      "expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\n",
      "though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\n",
      "which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\n",
      "every moment more valuable.\n",
      "They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\n",
      "be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\n",
      "soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\n",
      "to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\n",
      "London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\n",
      "substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\n",
      "every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,\n",
      "peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\n",
      "such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\n",
      "her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\n",
      "Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n",
      "“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\n",
      "to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that\n",
      "had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\n",
      "acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of\n",
      "my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\n",
      "abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\n",
      "your relations.”\n",
      "“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\n",
      "accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\n",
      "to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\n",
      "unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\n",
      "“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\n",
      "evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\n",
      "examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\n",
      "improved in civility.”\n",
      "“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\n",
      "then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\n",
      "it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\n",
      "reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a\n",
      "more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can\n",
      "scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\n",
      "confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\n",
      "“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\n",
      "impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\n",
      "a way.”\n",
      "“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\n",
      "feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\n",
      "forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\n",
      "way that would induce you to accept me.”\n",
      "“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\n",
      "all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\n",
      "Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you\n",
      "think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\n",
      "contents?”\n",
      "She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all\n",
      "her former prejudices had been removed.\n",
      "“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\n",
      "necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\n",
      "especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\n",
      "of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\n",
      "make you hate me.”\n",
      "“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\n",
      "preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\n",
      "opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\n",
      "changed as that implies.”\n",
      "“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly\n",
      "calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\n",
      "dreadful bitterness of spirit.”\n",
      "“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\n",
      "adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\n",
      "of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely\n",
      "different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\n",
      "attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\n",
      "philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\n",
      "pleasure.”\n",
      "“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\n",
      "retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\n",
      "arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\n",
      "ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\n",
      "intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\n",
      "selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\n",
      "child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\n",
      "temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\n",
      "and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\n",
      "I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\n",
      "particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\n",
      "almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\n",
      "my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n",
      "_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\n",
      "my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\n",
      "still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\n",
      "owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\n",
      "advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\n",
      "doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\n",
      "pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\n",
      "“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\n",
      "“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\n",
      "wishing, expecting my addresses.”\n",
      "“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\n",
      "you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\n",
      "wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”\n",
      "“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\n",
      "take a proper direction.”\n",
      "“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\n",
      "Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\n",
      "“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\n",
      "“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\n",
      "My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\n",
      "confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”\n",
      "“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\n",
      "in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\n",
      "to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\n",
      "see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\n",
      "introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\n",
      "an hour after I had seen you.”\n",
      "He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\n",
      "disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\n",
      "the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\n",
      "following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\n",
      "before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\n",
      "had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\n",
      "comprehend.\n",
      "She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\n",
      "each to be dwelt on farther.\n",
      "After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\n",
      "anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\n",
      "it was time to be at home.\n",
      "“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which\n",
      "introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with\n",
      "their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\n",
      "“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And\n",
      "though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\n",
      "the case.\n",
      "“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\n",
      "confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\n",
      "him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\n",
      "affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\n",
      "the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\n",
      "mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\n",
      "to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\n",
      "unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him\n",
      "that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”\n",
      "“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\n",
      "which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\n",
      "“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\n",
      "prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\n",
      "his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\n",
      "thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\n",
      "allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\n",
      "last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\n",
      "angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\n",
      "in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\n",
      "friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\n",
      "herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and\n",
      "it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of\n",
      "Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\n",
      "continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\n",
      "parted.\n",
      "CHAPTER LIX.\n",
      "“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question\n",
      "which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\n",
      "from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\n",
      "reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\n",
      "knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\n",
      "else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\n",
      "The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\n",
      "acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.\n",
      "Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\n",
      "and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\n",
      "than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\n",
      "there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\n",
      "the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\n",
      "liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n",
      "_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\n",
      "At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\n",
      "from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n",
      "“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\n",
      "you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”\n",
      "“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\n",
      "and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\n",
      "am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\n",
      "are engaged.”\n",
      "Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\n",
      "you dislike him.”\n",
      "“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\n",
      "did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\n",
      "a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\n",
      "remember it myself.”\n",
      "Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\n",
      "seriously, assured her of its truth.\n",
      "“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried\n",
      "Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\n",
      "certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\n",
      "happy with him?”\n",
      "“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\n",
      "are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\n",
      "Shall you like to have such a brother?”\n",
      "“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\n",
      "delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\n",
      "really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\n",
      "marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\n",
      "to do?”\n",
      "“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\n",
      "tell you all.”\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\n",
      "afraid you will be angry.”\n",
      "“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\n",
      "Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me\n",
      "how long you have loved him?”\n",
      "“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\n",
      "but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\n",
      "at Pemberley.”\n",
      "Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\n",
      "desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\n",
      "attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\n",
      "further to wish.\n",
      "“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I\n",
      "always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\n",
      "must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\n",
      "husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\n",
      "Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\n",
      "tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\n",
      "of it to another, not to you.”\n",
      "Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\n",
      "mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\n",
      "her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\n",
      "conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\n",
      "and half the night spent in conversation.\n",
      "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\n",
      "morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\n",
      "our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\n",
      "coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\n",
      "other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\n",
      "Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\n",
      "way.”\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\n",
      "was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\n",
      "epithet.\n",
      "As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\n",
      "shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\n",
      "and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\n",
      "hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\n",
      "“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\n",
      "to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\n",
      "never seen the view.”\n",
      "“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\n",
      "sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”\n",
      "Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\n",
      "curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\n",
      "consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\n",
      "saying,--\n",
      "“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\n",
      "disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\n",
      "all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\n",
      "him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\n",
      "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\n",
      "asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\n",
      "application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\n",
      "would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\n",
      "would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\n",
      "were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\n",
      "was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\n",
      "her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\n",
      "first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\n",
      "disapprobation.\n",
      "In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\n",
      "Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\n",
      "extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\n",
      "be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\n",
      "his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\n",
      "filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\n",
      "reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\n",
      "looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\n",
      "he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\n",
      "pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\n",
      "wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\n",
      "Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\n",
      "accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\n",
      "How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\n",
      "reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\n",
      "explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\n",
      "but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\n",
      "of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\n",
      "sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\n",
      "But will they make you happy?”\n",
      "“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\n",
      "indifference?”\n",
      "“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\n",
      "this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\n",
      "“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\n",
      "Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\n",
      "know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\n",
      "such terms.”\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\n",
      "of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\n",
      "condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\n",
      "having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\n",
      "disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\n",
      "respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\n",
      "up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\n",
      "greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\n",
      "discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n",
      "_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\n",
      "about.”\n",
      "Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\n",
      "and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\n",
      "object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\n",
      "estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\n",
      "his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\n",
      "months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\n",
      "she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\n",
      "match.\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\n",
      "say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\n",
      "you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\n",
      "To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\n",
      "had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n",
      "“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\n",
      "made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\n",
      "his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\n",
      "and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\n",
      "paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\n",
      "way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\n",
      "his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\n",
      "He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\n",
      "Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\n",
      "at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\n",
      "for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\n",
      "half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\n",
      "the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\n",
      "gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\n",
      "anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\n",
      "would come in time.\n",
      "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\n",
      "and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\n",
      "for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\n",
      "utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\n",
      "comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\n",
      "was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\n",
      "lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\n",
      "her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\n",
      "“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\n",
      "have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\n",
      "and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\n",
      "you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\n",
      "pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\n",
      "dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\n",
      "hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\n",
      "that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\n",
      "Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”\n",
      "This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\n",
      "Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\n",
      "soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\n",
      "her mother followed her.\n",
      "“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten\n",
      "thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a\n",
      "special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\n",
      "But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\n",
      "of, that I may have it to-morrow.”\n",
      "This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman\n",
      "himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\n",
      "possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\n",
      "consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\n",
      "passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\n",
      "in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\n",
      "to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\n",
      "her deference for his opinion.\n",
      "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\n",
      "acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\n",
      "every hour in his esteem.\n",
      "“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,\n",
      "is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\n",
      "as Jane’s.”\n",
      "CHAPTER LX.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\n",
      "Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could\n",
      "you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\n",
      "you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\n",
      "place?”\n",
      "“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\n",
      "laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\n",
      "knew that I _had_ begun.”\n",
      "“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\n",
      "to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\n",
      "to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\n",
      "sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\n",
      "“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”\n",
      "“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\n",
      "The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\n",
      "attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\n",
      "and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\n",
      "interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\n",
      "amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\n",
      "took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\n",
      "in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\n",
      "courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\n",
      "and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\n",
      "reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\n",
      "of _that_ when they fall in love.”\n",
      "“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was\n",
      "ill at Netherfield?”\n",
      "“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\n",
      "by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\n",
      "to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\n",
      "to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\n",
      "be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling\n",
      "to come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you\n",
      "first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you\n",
      "called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”\n",
      "“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”\n",
      "“But I was embarrassed.”\n",
      "“And so was I.”\n",
      "“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\n",
      "“A man who had felt less might.”\n",
      "“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\n",
      "I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\n",
      "_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\n",

      "unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\n",
      "she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\n",

      "Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\n",

      "     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\n",
      "     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n",
      "     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n",
      "     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n",
      "     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\n",

      "income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\n",
      "their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\n",
      "their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\n",
      "herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\n",
      "discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\n",
      "restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\n",
      "extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\n",
      "cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\n",
      "for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\n",
      "in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\n",
      "reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\n",

      "further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\n",

      "Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\n",
      "thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\n",
      "dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\n",
      "attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\n",
      "to Elizabeth.\n",
      "Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\n",
      "was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\n",
      "other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\n",
      "in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\n",
      "astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\n",
      "talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\n",
      "which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\n",
      "pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\n",

      "language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\n",
      "all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\n",
      "he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\n",

      "resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\n",

      "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently. “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he married or single?” “Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!” “How so? how can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?” “Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.” “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.” “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.” “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.” “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.” “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.” “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\n",
      "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate\n",
      "was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\n",
      "their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\n",
      "respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\n",
      "surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\n",
      "man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\n",
      "life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\n",
      "death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\n",
      "alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and\n",
      "received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood,\n",
      "the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he\n",
      "intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and\n",
      "their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His\n",
      "attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\n",
      "interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n",
      "comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\n",
      "children added a relish to his existence.\n",
      "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\n",
      "lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\n",
      "amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n",
      "and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\n",
      "marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\n",
      "wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\n",
      "so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\n",
      "of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that\n",
      "property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\n",
      "father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\n",
      "remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her\n",
      "child, and he had only a life-interest in it.\n",
      "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every\n",
      "other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\n",
      "unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but\n",
      "he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\n",
      "bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\n",
      "and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his\n",
      "son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,\n",
      "as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most\n",
      "dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the\n",
      "estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up\n",
      "for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his\n",
      "father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of\n",
      "his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\n",
      "of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest\n",
      "desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of\n",
      "noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for\n",
      "years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not\n",
      "to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three\n",
      "girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper\n",
      "was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many\n",
      "years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the\n",
      "produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\n",
      "improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\n",
      "his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\n",
      "thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained\n",
      "for his widow and daughters.\n",
      "His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\n",
      "Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\n",
      "could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\n",
      "family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\n",
      "such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\n",
      "them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\n",
      "and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there\n",
      "might prudently be in his power to do for them.\n",
      "He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\n",
      "and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\n",
      "respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\n",
      "his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might\n",
      "have been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have\n",
      "been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\n",
      "very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature\n",
      "of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.\n",
      "When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\n",
      "increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\n",
      "pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\n",
      "prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\n",
      "besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his\n",
      "heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. \"Yes, he would give\n",
      "them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\n",
      "be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he\n",
      "could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\" He\n",
      "thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did\n",
      "not repent.\n",
      "No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\n",
      "arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\n",
      "right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his\n",
      "father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\n",
      "greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common\n",
      "feelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in _her_ mind there\n",
      "was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any\n",
      "offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a\n",
      "source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a\n",
      "favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no\n",
      "opportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little\n",
      "attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion\n",
      "required it.\n",
      "So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\n",
      "earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\n",
      "arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\n",
      "not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on\n",
      "the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three\n",
      "children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid\n",
      "a breach with their brother.\n",
      "Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\n",
      "a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\n",
      "her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\n",
      "enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\n",
      "that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\n",
      "to imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was\n",
      "affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\n",
      "them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\n",
      "one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\n",
      "Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.\n",
      "She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\n",
      "joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable,\n",
      "interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between\n",
      "her and her mother was strikingly great.\n",
      "Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but\n",
      "by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\n",
      "other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief\n",
      "which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought\n",
      "for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to\n",
      "their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection\n",
      "that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation\n",
      "in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could\n",
      "struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother,\n",
      "could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with\n",
      "proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar\n",
      "exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.\n",
      "Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl;\n",
      "but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance,\n",
      "without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\n",
      "to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\n",
      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\n",
      "mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\n",
      "As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\n",
      "her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\n",
      "beyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them,\n",
      "with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no\n",
      "plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she\n",
      "could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his\n",
      "invitation was accepted.\n",
      "A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\n",
      "delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,\n",
      "no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\n",
      "degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\n",
      "itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\n",
      "and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\n",
      "to do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\n",
      "of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\n",
      "dreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How\n",
      "could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child\n",
      "too, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she\n",
      "considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so\n",
      "large an amount. It was very well known that no affection was ever\n",
      "supposed to exist between the children of any man by different\n",
      "marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little\n",
      "Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?\n",
      "\"It was my father's last request to me,\" replied her husband, \"that I\n",
      "should assist his widow and daughters.\"\n",
      "\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\n",
      "was light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he\n",
      "could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away\n",
      "half your fortune from your own child.\"\n",
      "\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\n",
      "requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\n",
      "situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it\n",
      "would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could\n",
      "hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise,\n",
      "I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.\n",
      "The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something\n",
      "must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new\n",
      "home.\"\n",
      "\"Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something\n",
      "need not be three thousand pounds. Consider,\" she added, \"that when\n",
      "the money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will\n",
      "marry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored\n",
      "to our poor little boy--\"\n",
      "\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely, \"that would make\n",
      "great difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so\n",
      "large a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for\n",
      "instance, it would be a very convenient addition.\"\n",
      "\"To be sure it would.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\n",
      "diminished one half. Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious\n",
      "increase to their fortunes!\"\n",
      "\"Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so\n",
      "much for his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is--only\n",
      "half blood! But you have such a generous spirit!\"\n",
      "\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied. \"One had rather,\n",
      "on such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can\n",
      "think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can\n",
      "hardly expect more.\"\n",
      "\"There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,\" said the lady, \"but we\n",
      "are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can\n",
      "afford to do.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly; and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\n",
      "a-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\n",
      "about three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very\n",
      "comfortable fortune for any young woman.\"\n",
      "\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\n",
      "addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\n",
      "them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\n",
      "not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of\n",
      "ten thousand pounds.\"\n",
      "\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\n",
      "whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother\n",
      "while she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I\n",
      "mean. My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\n",
      "A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\n",
      "His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this\n",
      "plan.\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with fifteen\n",
      "hundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live\n",
      "fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"\n",
      "\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\n",
      "purchase.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\n",
      "there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and\n",
      "healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it\n",
      "comes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You\n",
      "are not aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the\n",
      "trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of\n",
      "three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is\n",
      "amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these\n",
      "annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting\n",
      "it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards\n",
      "it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her\n",
      "income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it;\n",
      "and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money\n",
      "would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any\n",
      "restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities,\n",
      "that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\n",
      "all the world.\"\n",
      "\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood, \"to have\n",
      "those kind of yearly drains on one's income. One's fortune, as your\n",
      "mother justly says, is _not_ one's own. To be tied down to the regular\n",
      "payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\n",
      "takes away one's independence.\"\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think\n",
      "themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\n",
      "no gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at\n",
      "my own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any\n",
      "thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\n",
      "hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\n",
      "\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\n",
      "be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\n",
      "be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\n",
      "would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\n",
      "income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\n",
      "year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty\n",
      "pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\n",
      "money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my\n",
      "father.\"\n",
      "\"To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\n",
      "myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\n",
      "all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\n",
      "be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\n",
      "comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\n",
      "and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever\n",
      "they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther;\n",
      "indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but\n",
      "consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your\n",
      "mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven\n",
      "thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the\n",
      "girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of\n",
      "course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it.\n",
      "Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what\n",
      "on earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so\n",
      "cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no\n",
      "carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no\n",
      "company, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how\n",
      "comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot\n",
      "imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them\n",
      "more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able\n",
      "to give _you_ something.\"\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you are perfectly right.\n",
      "My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\n",
      "what you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\n",
      "my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\n",
      "have described. When my mother removes into another house my services\n",
      "shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little\n",
      "present of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood. \"But, however, _one_ thing\n",
      "must be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland,\n",
      "though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\n",
      "linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will\n",
      "therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\n",
      "\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy\n",
      "indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\n",
      "addition to our own stock here.\"\n",
      "\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\n",
      "belongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\n",
      "any place _they_ can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is.\n",
      "Your father thought only of _them_ And I must say this: that you owe\n",
      "no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we\n",
      "very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything\n",
      "in the world to _them._\"\n",
      "This argument was irresistible. It gave to his intentions whatever of\n",
      "decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be\n",
      "absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the\n",
      "widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts\n",
      "as his own wife pointed out.\n",
      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any\n",
      "disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased\n",
      "to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when\n",
      "her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other\n",
      "exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy\n",
      "remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her\n",
      "inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for\n",
      "to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could\n",
      "hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and\n",
      "ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier\n",
      "judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which\n",
      "her mother would have approved.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise\n",
      "on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last\n",
      "earthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no\n",
      "more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her\n",
      "daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\n",
      "persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her\n",
      "in affluence. For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his own\n",
      "heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to\n",
      "his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His\n",
      "attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\n",
      "their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied\n",
      "on the liberality of his intentions.\n",
      "The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for\n",
      "her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge\n",
      "of her character, which half a year's residence in her family\n",
      "afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or\n",
      "maternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\n",
      "have found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a\n",
      "particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility,\n",
      "according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters'\n",
      "continuance at Norland.\n",
      "This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and\n",
      "the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanlike and pleasing young\n",
      "man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's\n",
      "establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of\n",
      "his time there.\n",
      "Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of\n",
      "interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died\n",
      "very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,\n",
      "for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the\n",
      "will of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either\n",
      "consideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\n",
      "that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.\n",
      "It was contrary to every doctrine of her's that difference of fortune\n",
      "should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of\n",
      "disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by\n",
      "every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\n",
      "Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any\n",
      "peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his\n",
      "manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident\n",
      "to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\n",
      "his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.\n",
      "His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid\n",
      "improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\n",
      "answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\n",
      "distinguished as--they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a\n",
      "fine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to\n",
      "interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to\n",
      "see him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\n",
      "superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\n",
      "ambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for\n",
      "great men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort\n",
      "and the quiet of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother\n",
      "who was more promising.\n",
      "Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged\n",
      "much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such\n",
      "affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw\n",
      "only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He\n",
      "did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed\n",
      "conversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther,\n",
      "by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the\n",
      "difference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which\n",
      "recommended him most forcibly to her mother.\n",
      "\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.\n",
      "It implies everything amiable. I love him already.\"\n",
      "\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you know more of him.\"\n",
      "\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile. \"I feel no sentiment of\n",
      "approbation inferior to love.\"\n",
      "\"You may esteem him.\"\n",
      "\"I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. Her manners\n",
      "were attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily\n",
      "comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor\n",
      "perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his\n",
      "worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all\n",
      "her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was\n",
      "no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his\n",
      "temper affectionate.\n",
      "No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to\n",
      "Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and\n",
      "looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.\n",
      "\"In a few months, my dear Marianne,\" said she, \"Elinor will, in all\n",
      "probability be settled for life. We shall miss her; but _she_ will be\n",
      "happy.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"\n",
      "\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few\n",
      "miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will\n",
      "gain a brother--a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest\n",
      "opinion in the world of Edward's heart. But you look grave, Marianne;\n",
      "do you disapprove your sister's choice?\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it with some surprise.\n",
      "Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet--he is not\n",
      "the kind of young man; there is something wanting--his figure is not\n",
      "striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man\n",
      "who could seriously attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit,\n",
      "that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides\n",
      "all this, I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste. Music seems\n",
      "scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings very\n",
      "much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their\n",
      "worth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while\n",
      "she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter. He admires as\n",
      "a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be\n",
      "united. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every\n",
      "point coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the\n",
      "same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how\n",
      "spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!\n",
      "I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much\n",
      "composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my\n",
      "seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost\n",
      "driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such\n",
      "dreadful indifference!\"\n",
      "\"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant\n",
      "prose. I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.\"\n",
      "\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow\n",
      "for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she\n",
      "may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke _my_\n",
      "heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\n",
      "Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I\n",
      "shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He\n",
      "must have all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners must\n",
      "ornament his goodness with every possible charm.\"\n",
      "\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in\n",
      "life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate\n",
      "than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your\n",
      "destiny be different from her's!\"\n",
      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"that Edward should have\n",
      "no taste for drawing.\"\n",
      "\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should you think so? He\n",
      "does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the\n",
      "performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means\n",
      "deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of\n",
      "improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he\n",
      "would have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such\n",
      "matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on\n",
      "any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste,\n",
      "which in general direct him perfectly right.\"\n",
      "Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but\n",
      "the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by\n",
      "the drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous\n",
      "delight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet,\n",
      "though smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister\n",
      "for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\n",
      "\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not consider him as\n",
      "deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,\n",
      "for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were\n",
      "your opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\n",
      "Marianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of\n",
      "her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was\n",
      "impossible. At length she replied:\n",
      "\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing\n",
      "equal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many\n",
      "opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his\n",
      "inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion\n",
      "in the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that\n",
      "is worthy and amiable.\"\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile, \"that his dearest friends\n",
      "could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not\n",
      "perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.\"\n",
      "Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\n",
      "\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor, \"no one can, I\n",
      "think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in\n",
      "unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his\n",
      "principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\n",
      "him silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\n",
      "But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\n",
      "peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I\n",
      "have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\n",
      "wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I\n",
      "have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\n",
      "his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\n",
      "I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of\n",
      "books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just\n",
      "and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every\n",
      "respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\n",
      "At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person\n",
      "can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which\n",
      "are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is\n",
      "perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really\n",
      "handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?\"\n",
      "\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When\n",
      "you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection\n",
      "in his face, than I now do in his heart.\"\n",
      "Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she\n",
      "had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood\n",
      "very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but\n",
      "she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of\n",
      "their attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her\n",
      "mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,\n",
      "to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain\n",
      "the real state of the case to her sister.\n",
      "\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think very highly of\n",
      "him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\n",
      "Marianne here burst forth with indignation--\n",
      "\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than\n",
      "cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I\n",
      "will leave the room this moment.\"\n",
      "Elinor could not help laughing. \"Excuse me,\" said she; \"and be assured\n",
      "that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my\n",
      "own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;\n",
      "believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\n",
      "suspicion--the hope--of his affection for me may warrant, without\n",
      "imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am\n",
      "by no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the\n",
      "extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known,\n",
      "you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own\n",
      "partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I\n",
      "feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other\n",
      "points to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from\n",
      "being independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from\n",
      "Fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never\n",
      "been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if\n",
      "Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in\n",
      "his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a\n",
      "great fortune or high rank.\"\n",
      "Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother\n",
      "and herself had outstripped the truth.\n",
      "\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she. \"Yet it certainly\n",
      "soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I\n",
      "shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity\n",
      "of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\n",
      "be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he\n",
      "should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw\n",
      "himself, how delightful it would be!\"\n",
      "Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not\n",
      "consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as\n",
      "Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about\n",
      "him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something\n",
      "almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel\n",
      "it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to\n",
      "produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more\n",
      "reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which\n",
      "forbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother\n",
      "neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present,\n",
      "nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself,\n",
      "without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With\n",
      "such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on\n",
      "the subject. She was far from depending on that result of his\n",
      "preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as\n",
      "certain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed\n",
      "the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes,\n",
      "she believed it to be no more than friendship.\n",
      "But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when\n",
      "perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time,\n",
      "(which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first\n",
      "opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking\n",
      "to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the\n",
      "danger attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in_, that\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to\n",
      "be calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and\n",
      "instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the\n",
      "inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor\n",
      "should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.\n",
      "In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the\n",
      "post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the\n",
      "offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of\n",
      "her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\n",
      "letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\n",
      "of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\n",
      "dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a\n",
      "cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she\n",
      "might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly\n",
      "pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to\n",
      "come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own\n",
      "residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton\n",
      "Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any\n",
      "alteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to\n",
      "accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so\n",
      "friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin;\n",
      "more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and\n",
      "unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for\n",
      "deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The\n",
      "situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as\n",
      "Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a\n",
      "sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to\n",
      "the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood\n",
      "of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a\n",
      "blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her\n",
      "daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved\n",
      "place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a\n",
      "woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her\n",
      "acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\n",
      "and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters, that she\n",
      "might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.\n",
      "Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle\n",
      "at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present\n",
      "acquaintance. On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\n",
      "her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as\n",
      "described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so\n",
      "uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either\n",
      "point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any\n",
      "charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of\n",
      "Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother\n",
      "from sending a letter of acquiescence.\n",
      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged\n",
      "herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife\n",
      "that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no\n",
      "longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They\n",
      "heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her\n",
      "husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\n",
      "She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into\n",
      "Devonshire. Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and,\n",
      "in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to\n",
      "her, repeated, \"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from\n",
      "hence! And to what part of it?\" She explained the situation. It was\n",
      "within four miles northward of Exeter.\n",
      "\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope to see many of my\n",
      "friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends\n",
      "find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will\n",
      "find none in accommodating them.\"\n",
      "She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still\n",
      "greater affection. Though her late conversation with her\n",
      "daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer\n",
      "than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her\n",
      "in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and\n",
      "Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to\n",
      "show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother,\n",
      "how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly\n",
      "sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from\n",
      "Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her\n",
      "furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for\n",
      "the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his\n",
      "promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.\n",
      "The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of\n",
      "household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte\n",
      "of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh:\n",
      "she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income\n",
      "would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any\n",
      "handsome article of furniture.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready\n",
      "furnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty\n",
      "arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the\n",
      "disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future\n",
      "household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was\n",
      "exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested\n",
      "her, was soon done. The horses which were left her by her husband had\n",
      "been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of\n",
      "disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the\n",
      "earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her\n",
      "children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept\n",
      "it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited\n",
      "the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom\n",
      "they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their\n",
      "establishment at Norland.\n",
      "The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into\n",
      "Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as\n",
      "Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred\n",
      "going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and\n",
      "she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as\n",
      "to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her\n",
      "own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from\n",
      "diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the\n",
      "prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted\n",
      "to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\n",
      "Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might\n",
      "with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do\n",
      "it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be\n",
      "looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be\n",
      "convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his\n",
      "assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months\n",
      "at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of\n",
      "housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man\n",
      "of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to,\n",
      "that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to\n",
      "have any design of giving money away.\n",
      "In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's\n",
      "first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their\n",
      "future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin\n",
      "their journey.\n",
      "Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so\n",
      "much beloved. \"Dear, dear Norland!\" said Marianne, as she wandered\n",
      "alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there;\n",
      "\"when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home\n",
      "elsewhere! Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now\n",
      "viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no\n",
      "more! And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.\n",
      "No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become\n",
      "motionless although we can observe you no longer! No; you will\n",
      "continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you\n",
      "occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your\n",
      "shade! But who will remain to enjoy you?\"\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\n",
      "disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they\n",
      "drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\n",
      "country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a\n",
      "view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It\n",
      "was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After\n",
      "winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A\n",
      "small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat\n",
      "wicket gate admitted them into it.\n",
      "As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\n",
      "but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the\n",
      "roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were\n",
      "the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly\n",
      "through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance\n",
      "was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were\n",
      "the offices and the stairs. Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the\n",
      "rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good\n",
      "repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\n",
      "the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house\n",
      "were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on\n",
      "their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear\n",
      "happy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from\n",
      "first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they\n",
      "received an impression in its favour which was of material service in\n",
      "recommending it to their lasting approbation.\n",
      "The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately\n",
      "behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\n",
      "downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was\n",
      "chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\n",
      "cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it\n",
      "commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country\n",
      "beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley\n",
      "in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it\n",
      "branched out again between two of the steepest of them.\n",
      "With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the\n",
      "whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered\n",
      "many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was\n",
      "a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to\n",
      "supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. \"As\n",
      "for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is too small for our\n",
      "family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the\n",
      "present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in\n",
      "the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\n",
      "think about building. These parlors are both too small for such\n",
      "parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I\n",
      "have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with\n",
      "perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other\n",
      "for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily\n",
      "added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\n",
      "little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must\n",
      "not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult\n",
      "matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the\n",
      "world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\n",
      "In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the\n",
      "savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never\n",
      "saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the\n",
      "house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their\n",
      "particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and\n",
      "other possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne's pianoforte\n",
      "was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were\n",
      "affixed to the walls of their sitting room.\n",
      "In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after\n",
      "breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called\n",
      "to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from\n",
      "his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be\n",
      "deficient. Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He\n",
      "had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young\n",
      "cousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured;\n",
      "and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their\n",
      "arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to\n",
      "be an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest\n",
      "desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and\n",
      "pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they\n",
      "were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\n",
      "to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give\n",
      "offence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour\n",
      "after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit\n",
      "arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by\n",
      "a present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\n",
      "letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the\n",
      "satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.\n",
      "Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her\n",
      "intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured\n",
      "that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was\n",
      "answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced\n",
      "to them the next day.\n",
      "They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of\n",
      "their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her\n",
      "appearance was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more\n",
      "than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall\n",
      "and striking, and her address graceful. Her manners had all the\n",
      "elegance which her husband's wanted. But they would have been improved\n",
      "by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long\n",
      "enough to detract something from their first admiration, by showing\n",
      "that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had\n",
      "nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or\n",
      "remark.\n",
      "Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and\n",
      "Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her\n",
      "their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which\n",
      "means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in\n",
      "case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire\n",
      "his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him,\n",
      "while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise\n",
      "of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as\n",
      "he could make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child\n",
      "ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the\n",
      "present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were\n",
      "most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled\n",
      "either, for of course every body differed, and every body was\n",
      "astonished at the opinion of the others.\n",
      "An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on\n",
      "the rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house\n",
      "without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.\n",
      "CHAPTER VII\n",
      "Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had\n",
      "passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from\n",
      "their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large\n",
      "and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\n",
      "and elegance. The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter\n",
      "for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends\n",
      "staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every\n",
      "kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to\n",
      "the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\n",
      "behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\n",
      "talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\n",
      "such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\n",
      "sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\n",
      "humoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\n",
      "Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all\n",
      "the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in\n",
      "existence only half the time. Continual engagements at home and\n",
      "abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and\n",
      "education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise\n",
      "to the good breeding of his wife.\n",
      "Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of\n",
      "all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her\n",
      "greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John's\n",
      "satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\n",
      "about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier\n",
      "they were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the\n",
      "juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever\n",
      "forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in\n",
      "winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who\n",
      "was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen.\n",
      "The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy\n",
      "to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants\n",
      "he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were\n",
      "young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good\n",
      "opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to\n",
      "make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his\n",
      "disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\n",
      "might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\n",
      "showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\n",
      "of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\n",
      "cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,\n",
      "though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is\n",
      "not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a\n",
      "residence within his own manor.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by\n",
      "Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;\n",
      "and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young\n",
      "ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day\n",
      "before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They\n",
      "would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a\n",
      "particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither\n",
      "very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness\n",
      "of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.\n",
      "He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring\n",
      "some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was\n",
      "full of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at\n",
      "Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable\n",
      "woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as\n",
      "they might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were\n",
      "perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and\n",
      "wished for no more.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,\n",
      "fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and\n",
      "rather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner\n",
      "was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and\n",
      "husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\n",
      "and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was\n",
      "vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor\n",
      "to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave\n",
      "Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery\n",
      "as Mrs. Jennings's.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by\n",
      "resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be\n",
      "his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother. He was\n",
      "silent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\n",
      "of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old\n",
      "bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though\n",
      "his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his\n",
      "address was particularly gentlemanlike.\n",
      "There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as\n",
      "companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton\n",
      "was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity\n",
      "of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\n",
      "mother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to\n",
      "enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after\n",
      "dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to\n",
      "every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.\n",
      "In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was\n",
      "invited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to\n",
      "be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went\n",
      "through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\n",
      "the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in\n",
      "the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated\n",
      "that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, she\n",
      "had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\n",
      "Marianne's performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his\n",
      "admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation\n",
      "with the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently\n",
      "called him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be\n",
      "diverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a\n",
      "particular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon\n",
      "alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid\n",
      "her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him\n",
      "on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their\n",
      "shameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not\n",
      "to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,\n",
      "was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of\n",
      "the others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five\n",
      "and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every\n",
      "exquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every\n",
      "allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity\n",
      "required.\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two\n",
      "daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and\n",
      "she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the\n",
      "world. In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as\n",
      "far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting\n",
      "weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was\n",
      "remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the\n",
      "advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady\n",
      "by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of\n",
      "discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to\n",
      "pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne\n",
      "Dashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening\n",
      "of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she\n",
      "sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons'\n",
      "dining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to\n",
      "her again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would\n",
      "be an excellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome. Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever\n",
      "since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\n",
      "and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty\n",
      "girl.\n",
      "The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for\n",
      "it supplied her with endless jokes against them both. At the park she\n",
      "laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former\n",
      "her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\n",
      "perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first\n",
      "incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew\n",
      "whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,\n",
      "for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel's\n",
      "advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than\n",
      "herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy\n",
      "of her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability\n",
      "of wishing to throw ridicule on his age.\n",
      "\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,\n",
      "though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon\n",
      "is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be\n",
      "_my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must\n",
      "have long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!\n",
      "When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not\n",
      "protect him?\"\n",
      "\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can\n",
      "easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my\n",
      "mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use\n",
      "of his limbs!\"\n",
      "\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the\n",
      "commonest infirmity of declining life?\"\n",
      "\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing, \"at this rate you must\n",
      "be in continual terror of _my_ decay; and it must seem to you a\n",
      "miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.\"\n",
      "\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel\n",
      "Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of\n",
      "losing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer.\n",
      "But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had better not have\n",
      "any thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any\n",
      "chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I\n",
      "should not think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to\n",
      "his marrying _her_ .\"\n",
      "\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne, after pausing a moment,\n",
      "\"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be\n",
      "uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might\n",
      "bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the\n",
      "provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman\n",
      "therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of\n",
      "convenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be\n",
      "no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem\n",
      "only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at\n",
      "the expense of the other.\"\n",
      "\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor, \"to convince you\n",
      "that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five\n",
      "anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to\n",
      "her. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to\n",
      "the constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced\n",
      "to complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic\n",
      "feel in one of his shoulders.\"\n",
      "\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne; \"and with me a\n",
      "flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,\n",
      "rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and\n",
      "the feeble.\"\n",
      "\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him\n",
      "half so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to\n",
      "you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"\n",
      "Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, \"Mamma,\" said\n",
      "Marianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot\n",
      "conceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now\n",
      "been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but\n",
      "real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else\n",
      "can detain him at Norland?\"\n",
      "\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\" said Mrs. Dashwood. \"I had\n",
      "none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the\n",
      "subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\n",
      "of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of\n",
      "his coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?\"\n",
      "\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.\"\n",
      "\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her\n",
      "yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed-chamber, she\n",
      "observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not\n",
      "likely that the room would be wanted for some time.\"\n",
      "\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of\n",
      "their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how\n",
      "composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the\n",
      "last evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was\n",
      "no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an\n",
      "affectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely\n",
      "together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most\n",
      "unaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting\n",
      "Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is\n",
      "invariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to\n",
      "avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?\"\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to\n",
      "themselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding\n",
      "them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had\n",
      "given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far\n",
      "greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss\n",
      "of their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for\n",
      "the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much\n",
      "occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them\n",
      "always employed.\n",
      "Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in\n",
      "spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at\n",
      "their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the\n",
      "wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to\n",
      "visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who\n",
      "could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.\n",
      "About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding\n",
      "valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly\n",
      "described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered\n",
      "an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a\n",
      "little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to\n",
      "be better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its\n",
      "possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately\n",
      "too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.\n",
      "The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high\n",
      "downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\n",
      "seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\n",
      "alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their\n",
      "superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and\n",
      "Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\n",
      "partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the\n",
      "confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had\n",
      "occasioned. The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others\n",
      "from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration\n",
      "that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud\n",
      "would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\n",
      "together.\n",
      "They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at\n",
      "every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the\n",
      "animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears\n",
      "which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such\n",
      "delightful sensations.\n",
      "\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne, \"superior to\n",
      "this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.\"\n",
      "Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind,\n",
      "resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer,\n",
      "when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain\n",
      "set full in their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged,\n",
      "though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their\n",
      "own house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the\n",
      "exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of\n",
      "running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which\n",
      "led immediately to their garden gate.\n",
      "They set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step\n",
      "brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop\n",
      "herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached\n",
      "the bottom in safety.\n",
      "A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was\n",
      "passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her\n",
      "accident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She\n",
      "had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in\n",
      "her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered\n",
      "his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her\n",
      "situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther\n",
      "delay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden,\n",
      "the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly\n",
      "into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his\n",
      "hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.\n",
      "Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and\n",
      "while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a\n",
      "secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he\n",
      "apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so\n",
      "frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome,\n",
      "received additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been\n",
      "even old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child;\n",
      "but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to\n",
      "the action which came home to her feelings.\n",
      "She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address\n",
      "which always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he\n",
      "declined, as he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know\n",
      "to whom she was obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his\n",
      "present home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him\n",
      "the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The\n",
      "honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself\n",
      "still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.\n",
      "His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\n",
      "theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\n",
      "against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\n",
      "attractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the\n",
      "rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\n",
      "her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\n",
      "entering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the\n",
      "admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\n",
      "praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\n",
      "for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\n",
      "house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\n",
      "thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\n",
      "circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\n",
      "residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\n",
      "of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her\n",
      "imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\n",
      "sprained ankle was disregarded.\n",
      "Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\n",
      "that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident\n",
      "being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any\n",
      "gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\n",
      "\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is _he_ in the country? That is\n",
      "good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on\n",
      "Thursday.\"\n",
      "\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "\"Know him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year.\"\n",
      "\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\n",
      "\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent\n",
      "shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.\"\n",
      "\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne, indignantly.\n",
      "\"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his\n",
      "pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\n",
      "Sir John was rather puzzled.\n",
      "\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him as to all\n",
      "_that._ But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the\n",
      "nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with\n",
      "him today?\"\n",
      "But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\"But who is he?\" said Elinor. \"Where does he come from? Has he a house\n",
      "at Allenham?\"\n",
      "On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\n",
      "told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\n",
      "country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\n",
      "at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he\n",
      "was to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I\n",
      "can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own\n",
      "in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up\n",
      "to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss\n",
      "Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will\n",
      "be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\n",
      "\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,\n",
      "\"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of\n",
      "_my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him._ It is not an\n",
      "employment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with\n",
      "us, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what\n",
      "you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose\n",
      "acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\n",
      "\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,\" repeated\n",
      "Sir John. \"I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he\n",
      "danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\n",
      "\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, \"and with\n",
      "elegance, with spirit?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\n",
      "\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever\n",
      "be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and\n",
      "leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see how it will\n",
      "be. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor\n",
      "Brandon.\"\n",
      "\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne, warmly, \"which I\n",
      "particularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit\n",
      "is intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,'\n",
      "are the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and\n",
      "if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago\n",
      "destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\n",
      "Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as\n",
      "heartily as if he did, and then replied--\n",
      "\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.\n",
      "Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth\n",
      "setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling\n",
      "about and spraining of ankles.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,\n",
      "styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to\n",
      "make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with\n",
      "more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him\n",
      "and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the\n",
      "visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,\n",
      "and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced\n",
      "him. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview\n",
      "to be convinced.\n",
      "Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a\n",
      "remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,\n",
      "though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of\n",
      "height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in\n",
      "the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was\n",
      "less violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,\n",
      "but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant;\n",
      "her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in\n",
      "her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an\n",
      "eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From\n",
      "Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the\n",
      "embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But\n",
      "when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw\n",
      "that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united\n",
      "frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\n",
      "that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such\n",
      "a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to\n",
      "herself for the rest of his stay.\n",
      "It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\n",
      "to talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\n",
      "she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily\n",
      "discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\n",
      "that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that\n",
      "related to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his\n",
      "opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her\n",
      "favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so\n",
      "rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have\n",
      "been insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the\n",
      "excellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was\n",
      "strikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by\n",
      "each; or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no\n",
      "longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her\n",
      "eyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught\n",
      "all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they\n",
      "conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\n",
      "\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \"for _one_\n",
      "morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already\n",
      "ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of\n",
      "importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are\n",
      "certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have\n",
      "received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\n",
      "But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\n",
      "extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon\n",
      "have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to\n",
      "explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages,\n",
      "and then you can have nothing farther to ask.\"\n",
      "\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\n",
      "scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too\n",
      "happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of\n",
      "decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\n",
      "reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful:--had I talked only of the\n",
      "weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this\n",
      "reproach would have been spared.\"\n",
      "\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended with Elinor--she\n",
      "was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of\n",
      "wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new\n",
      "friend.\" Marianne was softened in a moment.\n",
      "Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\n",
      "acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He\n",
      "came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his\n",
      "excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day\n",
      "gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had\n",
      "ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery. She was\n",
      "confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement\n",
      "been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\n",
      "imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was\n",
      "exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he\n",
      "joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind\n",
      "which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and\n",
      "which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\n",
      "His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,\n",
      "they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were\n",
      "considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which\n",
      "Edward had unfortunately wanted.\n",
      "In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's;\n",
      "and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\n",
      "strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\n",
      "much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons\n",
      "or circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\n",
      "people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of\n",
      "undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too\n",
      "easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution\n",
      "which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne\n",
      "could say in its support.\n",
      "Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\n",
      "her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\n",
      "ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was\n",
      "all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\n",
      "brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour\n",
      "declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\n",
      "were strong.\n",
      "Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\n",
      "marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before\n",
      "the end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate\n",
      "herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and\n",
      "Willoughby.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so\n",
      "early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to\n",
      "Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit\n",
      "were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the\n",
      "other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his\n",
      "feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to\n",
      "sensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that\n",
      "the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own\n",
      "satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that\n",
      "however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might\n",
      "forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking\n",
      "opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five\n",
      "and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?\n",
      "and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him\n",
      "indifferent. She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she\n",
      "beheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were\n",
      "mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of\n",
      "spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped\n",
      "hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief\n",
      "of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and\n",
      "compassion.\n",
      "Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted\n",
      "by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being\n",
      "neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\n",
      "\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby one day, when they\n",
      "were talking of him together, \"whom every body speaks well of, and\n",
      "nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody\n",
      "remembers to talk to.\"\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it is injustice in\n",
      "both of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and\n",
      "I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.\"\n",
      "\"That he is patronised by _you_,\" replied Willoughby, \"is certainly in\n",
      "his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in\n",
      "itself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a\n",
      "woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the\n",
      "indifference of any body else?\"\n",
      "\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will\n",
      "make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their\n",
      "praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more\n",
      "undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\n",
      "\"In defence of your _protÈgÈ_ you can even be saucy.\"\n",
      "\"My _protÈgÈ_, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will\n",
      "always have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between\n",
      "thirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been\n",
      "abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of\n",
      "giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always\n",
      "answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good\n",
      "nature.\"\n",
      "\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously, \"he has told you,\n",
      "that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are\n",
      "troublesome.\"\n",
      "\"He _would_ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such\n",
      "inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been\n",
      "previously informed.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may have extended to the\n",
      "existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.\"\n",
      "\"I may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much\n",
      "further than _your_ candour. But why should you dislike him?\"\n",
      "\"I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very\n",
      "respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;\n",
      "who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to\n",
      "employ, and two new coats every year.\"\n",
      "\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has neither genius, taste,\n",
      "nor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no\n",
      "ardour, and his voice no expression.\"\n",
      "\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\" replied Elinor,\n",
      "\"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the\n",
      "commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and\n",
      "insipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,\n",
      "well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an\n",
      "amiable heart.\"\n",
      "\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using me unkindly. You\n",
      "are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my\n",
      "will. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be\n",
      "artful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel\n",
      "Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he\n",
      "has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade\n",
      "him to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you,\n",
      "however, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other\n",
      "respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for\n",
      "an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me\n",
      "the privilege of disliking him as much as ever.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first\n",
      "came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy\n",
      "their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have\n",
      "such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them\n",
      "little leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When\n",
      "Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad,\n",
      "which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution.\n",
      "The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water\n",
      "were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\n",
      "In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\n",
      "familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\n",
      "calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\n",
      "Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\n",
      "Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\n",
      "in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\n",
      "affection.\n",
      "Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished\n",
      "that it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to\n",
      "suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne\n",
      "abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend\n",
      "unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in\n",
      "themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary\n",
      "effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and\n",
      "mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\n",
      "all times, was an illustration of their opinions.\n",
      "When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he\n",
      "did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at\n",
      "the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the\n",
      "rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the\n",
      "amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when\n",
      "obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand\n",
      "together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made\n",
      "them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not\n",
      "shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left\n",
      "her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her\n",
      "it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young\n",
      "and ardent mind.\n",
      "This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to\n",
      "Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with\n",
      "her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought\n",
      "it possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her\n",
      "present home.\n",
      "Elinor's happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at\n",
      "ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded\n",
      "her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,\n",
      "nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than\n",
      "ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the\n",
      "conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting\n",
      "talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which\n",
      "ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated\n",
      "her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory\n",
      "been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very\n",
      "early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last\n",
      "illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.\n",
      "Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more\n",
      "silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve\n",
      "was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.\n",
      "Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and\n",
      "intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had\n",
      "nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her\n",
      "insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same;\n",
      "and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband,\n",
      "provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest\n",
      "children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment\n",
      "from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home; and so\n",
      "little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any\n",
      "share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of\n",
      "her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\n",
      "In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\n",
      "a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities,\n",
      "excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.\n",
      "Willoughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even\n",
      "her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his\n",
      "attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might\n",
      "have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for\n",
      "himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in\n",
      "conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\n",
      "indifference of her sister.\n",
      "Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\n",
      "that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\n",
      "This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\n",
      "him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\n",
      "mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on\n",
      "Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\n",
      "smile, \"Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second\n",
      "attachments.\"\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\n",
      "\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.\"\n",
      "\"I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on\n",
      "the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know\n",
      "not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable\n",
      "basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy\n",
      "to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\"\n",
      "\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied; \"and yet there is\n",
      "something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is\n",
      "sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor. \"There are\n",
      "inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the\n",
      "charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her\n",
      "systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at\n",
      "nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\n",
      "forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\n",
      "After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying--\n",
      "\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a\n",
      "second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those\n",
      "who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the\n",
      "inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\n",
      "equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiÊ of her principles.\n",
      "I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second\n",
      "attachment's being pardonable.\"\n",
      "\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\n",
      "sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic\n",
      "refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently\n",
      "are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\n",
      "dangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper\n",
      "and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like\n",
      "her, but who from an enforced change--from a series of unfortunate\n",
      "circumstances--\" Here he stopped suddenly; appeared to think that he\n",
      "had said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\n",
      "which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head. The lady would\n",
      "probably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss\n",
      "Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it\n",
      "was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion\n",
      "with the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more.\n",
      "But Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole\n",
      "story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination;\n",
      "and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous\n",
      "love.\n",
      "CHAPTER XII\n",
      "As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the\n",
      "latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of\n",
      "all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,\n",
      "surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her,\n",
      "with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one\n",
      "that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\n",
      "exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was\n",
      "not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter\n",
      "her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the\n",
      "servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\n",
      "to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and\n",
      "told her sister of it in raptures.\n",
      "\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,\"\n",
      "she added, \"and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall\n",
      "share its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the\n",
      "delight of a gallop on some of these downs.\"\n",
      "Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to\n",
      "comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for\n",
      "some time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,\n",
      "the expense would be a trifle; Mamma she was sure would never object\n",
      "to it; and any horse would do for _him_; he might always get one at\n",
      "the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor\n",
      "then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present\n",
      "from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too\n",
      "much.\n",
      "\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly, \"in supposing I know very\n",
      "little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much\n",
      "better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the\n",
      "world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is\n",
      "to determine intimacy; it is disposition alone. Seven years would be\n",
      "insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\n",
      "days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of\n",
      "greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\n",
      "Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together\n",
      "for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"\n",
      "Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her\n",
      "sister's temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach\n",
      "her the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for\n",
      "her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\n",
      "mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she\n",
      "consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly\n",
      "subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent\n",
      "kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw\n",
      "him next, that it must be declined.\n",
      "She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the\n",
      "cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to\n",
      "him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his\n",
      "present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time\n",
      "related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side\n",
      "impossible. His concern however was very apparent; and after\n",
      "expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice, \"But,\n",
      "Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I\n",
      "shall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to\n",
      "form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall\n",
      "receive you.\"\n",
      "This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the\n",
      "sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her\n",
      "sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so\n",
      "decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between\n",
      "them. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each\n",
      "other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she,\n",
      "or any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to\n",
      "discover it by accident.\n",
      "Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this\n",
      "matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding\n",
      "evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the\n",
      "parlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for\n",
      "observations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to\n",
      "her eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.\n",
      "\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to tell you about\n",
      "Marianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"\n",
      "\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every day since they first\n",
      "met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I\n",
      "believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round\n",
      "her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great\n",
      "uncle.\"\n",
      "\"But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be\n",
      "married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.\"\n",
      "\"Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of\n",
      "_his_.\"\n",
      "\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I\n",
      "saw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out\n",
      "of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as\n",
      "could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently\n",
      "he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it\n",
      "was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a\n",
      "piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.\"\n",
      "For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not\n",
      "withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance\n",
      "was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.\n",
      "Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory\n",
      "to her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the\n",
      "park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular\n",
      "favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\n",
      "Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, \"I must not\n",
      "tell, may I, Elinor?\"\n",
      "This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.\n",
      "But the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed\n",
      "on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a\n",
      "standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good\n",
      "to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to\n",
      "Margaret--\n",
      "\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to\n",
      "repeat them.\"\n",
      "\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret; \"it was you\n",
      "who told me of it yourself.\"\n",
      "This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly\n",
      "pressed to say something more.\n",
      "\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings. \"What is the gentleman's name?\"\n",
      "\"I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is; and I know\n",
      "where he is too.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be\n",
      "sure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say.\"\n",
      "\"No, _that_ he is not. He is of no profession at all.\"\n",
      "\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth, \"you know that all this\n",
      "is an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in\n",
      "existence.\"\n",
      "\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such\n",
      "a man once, and his name begins with an F.\"\n",
      "Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this\n",
      "moment, \"that it rained very hard,\" though she believed the\n",
      "interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her\n",
      "ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as\n",
      "delighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was\n",
      "immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion\n",
      "mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of\n",
      "rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked\n",
      "Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of\n",
      "different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so\n",
      "easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.\n",
      "A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see\n",
      "a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a\n",
      "brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not\n",
      "be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict\n",
      "orders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\n",
      "and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be\n",
      "allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit\n",
      "them, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years. They\n",
      "contained a noble piece of water--a sail on which was to a form a\n",
      "great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be\n",
      "taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted\n",
      "in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\n",
      "To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,\n",
      "considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the\n",
      "last fortnight; and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was\n",
      "persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIII\n",
      "Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from\n",
      "what Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through,\n",
      "fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate,\n",
      "for they did not go at all.\n",
      "By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they\n",
      "were to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had\n",
      "rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\n",
      "and the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and\n",
      "good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the\n",
      "greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.\n",
      "While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the\n",
      "rest there was one for Colonel Brandon:--he took it, looked at the\n",
      "direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.\n",
      "\"What is the matter with Brandon?\" said Sir John.\n",
      "Nobody could tell.\n",
      "\"I hope he has had no bad news,\" said Lady Middleton. \"It must be\n",
      "something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my\n",
      "breakfast table so suddenly.\"\n",
      "In about five minutes he returned.\n",
      "\"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;\" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he\n",
      "entered the room.\n",
      "\"None at all, ma'am, I thank you.\"\n",
      "\"Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is\n",
      "worse.\"\n",
      "\"No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.\"\n",
      "\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a\n",
      "letter of business? Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear\n",
      "the truth of it.\"\n",
      "\"My dear madam,\" said Lady Middleton, \"recollect what you are saying.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?\" said\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof.\n",
      "\"No, indeed, it is not.\"\n",
      "\"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well.\"\n",
      "\"Whom do you mean, ma'am?\" said he, colouring a little.\n",
      "\"Oh! you know who I mean.\"\n",
      "\"I am particularly sorry, ma'am,\" said he, addressing Lady Middleton,\n",
      "\"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which\n",
      "requires my immediate attendance in town.\"\n",
      "\"In town!\" cried Mrs. Jennings. \"What can you have to do in town at\n",
      "this time of year?\"\n",
      "\"My own loss is great,\" he continued, \"in being obliged to leave so\n",
      "agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence\n",
      "is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.\"\n",
      "What a blow upon them all was this!\n",
      "\"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,\" said\n",
      "Marianne, eagerly, \"will it not be sufficient?\"\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\"We must go,\" said Sir John. \"It shall not be put off when we are so\n",
      "near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.\"\n",
      "\"I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to\n",
      "delay my journey for one day!\"\n",
      "\"If you would but let us know what your business is,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, \"we might see whether it could be put off or not.\"\n",
      "\"You would not be six hours later,\" said Willoughby, \"if you were to\n",
      "defer your journey till our return.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot afford to lose _one_ hour.\"\n",
      "Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, \"There\n",
      "are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of\n",
      "them. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this\n",
      "trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was\n",
      "of his own writing.\"\n",
      "\"I have no doubt of it,\" replied Marianne.\n",
      "\"There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of\n",
      "old,\" said Sir John, \"when once you are determined on anything. But,\n",
      "however, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the\n",
      "two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked\n",
      "up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his\n",
      "usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\"\n",
      "Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of\n",
      "disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be\n",
      "unavoidable.\n",
      "\"Well, then, when will you come back again?\"\n",
      "\"I hope we shall see you at Barton,\" added her ladyship, \"as soon as\n",
      "you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to\n",
      "Whitwell till you return.\"\n",
      "\"You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in\n",
      "my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! he must and shall come back,\" cried Sir John. \"If he is not here\n",
      "by the end of the week, I shall go after him.\"\n",
      "\"Ay, so do, Sir John,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"and then perhaps you may\n",
      "find out what his business is.\"\n",
      "\"I do not want to pry into other men's concerns. I suppose it is\n",
      "something he is ashamed of.\"\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.\n",
      "\"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?\" added Sir John.\n",
      "\"No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post.\"\n",
      "\"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you\n",
      "had better change your mind.\"\n",
      "\"I assure you it is not in my power.\"\n",
      "He then took leave of the whole party.\n",
      "\"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this\n",
      "winter, Miss Dashwood?\"\n",
      "\"I am afraid, none at all.\"\n",
      "\"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to\n",
      "do.\"\n",
      "To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\n",
      "\"Come Colonel,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"before you go, do let us know\n",
      "what you are going about.\"\n",
      "He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto\n",
      "restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and\n",
      "again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.\n",
      "\"I can guess what his business is, however,\" said Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "exultingly.\n",
      "\"Can you, ma'am?\" said almost every body.\n",
      "\"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.\"\n",
      "\"And who is Miss Williams?\" asked Marianne.\n",
      "\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have\n",
      "heard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a\n",
      "very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the\n",
      "young ladies.\" Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\n",
      "\"She is his natural daughter.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel\n",
      "will leave her all his fortune.\"\n",
      "When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret\n",
      "on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as\n",
      "they were all got together, they must do something by way of being\n",
      "happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although\n",
      "happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\n",
      "tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The\n",
      "carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne\n",
      "never looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through the\n",
      "park very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of\n",
      "them was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the\n",
      "return of all the rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive;\n",
      "but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while\n",
      "the others went on the downs.\n",
      "It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\n",
      "every body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the\n",
      "Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down\n",
      "nearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great\n",
      "contentment. Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder\n",
      "Miss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had\n",
      "not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and\n",
      "said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, \"I have found you\n",
      "out in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.\"\n",
      "Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, \"Where, pray?\"\n",
      "\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had been out in my\n",
      "curricle?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined\n",
      "to find out _where_ you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss\n",
      "Marianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,\n",
      "I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when\n",
      "I was there six years ago.\"\n",
      "Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed\n",
      "heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\n",
      "had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\n",
      "they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\n",
      "walking about the garden and going all over the house.\n",
      "Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very\n",
      "unlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter\n",
      "the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the\n",
      "smallest acquaintance.\n",
      "As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\n",
      "and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance\n",
      "related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry\n",
      "with her for doubting it.\n",
      "\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\n",
      "did not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do\n",
      "yourself?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and\n",
      "with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to\n",
      "show that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was\n",
      "impossible to have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter\n",
      "morning in my life.\"\n",
      "\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness of an employment\n",
      "does not always evince its propriety.\"\n",
      "\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for\n",
      "if there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have\n",
      "been sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting\n",
      "wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\n",
      "\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very\n",
      "impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of\n",
      "your own conduct?\"\n",
      "\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of\n",
      "impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our\n",
      "lives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her\n",
      "commendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in\n",
      "walking over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house. They will\n",
      "one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and--\"\n",
      "\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be\n",
      "justified in what you have done.\"\n",
      "She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;\n",
      "and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her\n",
      "sister again, and said with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it\n",
      "_was_ rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "wanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house,\n",
      "I assure you. There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs;\n",
      "of a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture\n",
      "it would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two\n",
      "sides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the\n",
      "house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view\n",
      "of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills\n",
      "that we have so often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for\n",
      "nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture; but if it were newly\n",
      "fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it\n",
      "one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England.\"\n",
      "Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the\n",
      "others, she would have described every room in the house with equal\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with\n",
      "his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised\n",
      "the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great\n",
      "wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all\n",
      "the comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with\n",
      "little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there\n",
      "must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that\n",
      "could have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not\n",
      "escape them all.\n",
      "\"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,\" said she.\n",
      "\"I could see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances\n",
      "may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two\n",
      "thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do\n",
      "think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else\n",
      "can it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know\n",
      "the truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I\n",
      "dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\n",
      "May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I\n",
      "have a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is\n",
      "about Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed\n",
      "in his circumstances _now_, for he is a very prudent man, and to be\n",
      "sure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can\n",
      "be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.\n",
      "His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him\n",
      "out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the\n",
      "bargain.\"\n",
      "So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every\n",
      "fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.\n",
      "Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\n",
      "away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides\n",
      "that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting\n",
      "amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise\n",
      "disposed of. It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her\n",
      "sister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be\n",
      "peculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every\n",
      "day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the\n",
      "disposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her\n",
      "mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other\n",
      "declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.\n",
      "She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in\n",
      "their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no\n",
      "reason to believe him rich. His estate had been rated by Sir John at\n",
      "about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which\n",
      "that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\n",
      "of his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by\n",
      "them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at\n",
      "all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to\n",
      "their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\n",
      "her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to\n",
      "prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\n",
      "Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than\n",
      "Willoughby's behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing\n",
      "tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the\n",
      "family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The\n",
      "cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many\n",
      "more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general\n",
      "engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him\n",
      "out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest\n",
      "of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\n",
      "favourite pointer at her feet.\n",
      "One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the\n",
      "country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of\n",
      "attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening\n",
      "to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he\n",
      "warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had\n",
      "established as perfect with him.\n",
      "\"What!\" he exclaimed, \"Improve this dear cottage! No. _That_ I will\n",
      "never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch\n",
      "to its size, if my feelings are regarded.\"\n",
      "\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood, \"nothing of the kind will be\n",
      "done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.\"\n",
      "\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried. \"May she always be poor, if she\n",
      "can employ her riches no better.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not\n",
      "sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one\n",
      "whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it\n",
      "that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in\n",
      "the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it\n",
      "in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this\n",
      "place as to see no defect in it?\"\n",
      "\"I am,\" said he. \"To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as\n",
      "the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I\n",
      "rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again\n",
      "in the exact plan of this cottage.\"\n",
      "\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,\" said\n",
      "Elinor.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all and every thing\n",
      "belonging to it--in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,\n",
      "should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under\n",
      "such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at\n",
      "Barton.\"\n",
      "\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under the disadvantage\n",
      "of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your\n",
      "own house as faultless as you now do this.\"\n",
      "\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby, \"which might\n",
      "greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of\n",
      "my affection, which no other can possibly share.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were\n",
      "fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she\n",
      "understood him.\n",
      "\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at Allenham this time\n",
      "twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within\n",
      "view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one\n",
      "should live in it. How little did I then think that the very first\n",
      "news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,\n",
      "would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate\n",
      "satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of\n",
      "prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account\n",
      "for. Must it not have been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered\n",
      "voice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this house\n",
      "you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by\n",
      "imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance\n",
      "first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by\n",
      "us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\n",
      "and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has\n",
      "hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort\n",
      "than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world\n",
      "could possibly afford.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should\n",
      "be attempted.\n",
      "\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied. \"Your promise makes me\n",
      "easy. Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me\n",
      "that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever\n",
      "find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will\n",
      "always consider me with the kindness which has made everything\n",
      "belonging to you so dear to me.\"\n",
      "The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the\n",
      "whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.\n",
      "\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was\n",
      "leaving them. \"I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must\n",
      "walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.\"\n",
      "He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.\n",
      "CHAPTER XV\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and\n",
      "two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from\n",
      "being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her\n",
      "mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the\n",
      "night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly\n",
      "satisfied with her remaining at home.\n",
      "On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and\n",
      "servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced\n",
      "that her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had\n",
      "foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had\n",
      "taught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne\n",
      "came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with\n",
      "her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\n",
      "Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\n",
      "just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning\n",
      "against the mantelpiece with his back towards them. He turned round\n",
      "on their coming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly\n",
      "partook of the emotion which overpowered Marianne.\n",
      "\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she\n",
      "entered:--\"is she ill?\"\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced\n",
      "smile presently added, \"It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I\n",
      "am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!\"\n",
      "\"Disappointment?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has\n",
      "this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent\n",
      "cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my\n",
      "dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\n",
      "exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\n",
      "\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\n",
      "\"Almost this moment.\"\n",
      "\"This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged, and her\n",
      "business will not detain you from us long I hope.\"\n",
      "He coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I have no idea of\n",
      "returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are\n",
      "never repeated within the twelvemonth.\"\n",
      "\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the\n",
      "neighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can\n",
      "you wait for an invitation here?\"\n",
      "His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only\n",
      "replied, \"You are too good.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal\n",
      "amazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\n",
      "will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\n",
      "immediately, because you only can judge how far _that_ might be\n",
      "pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed\n",
      "to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\n",
      "\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby, confusedly, \"are of\n",
      "such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself--\"\n",
      "He stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and\n",
      "another pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with\n",
      "a faint smile, \"It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not\n",
      "torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it\n",
      "is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\n",
      "He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him\n",
      "step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\n",
      "parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\n",
      "sudden departure occasioned.\n",
      "Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's. She thought of\n",
      "what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviour\n",
      "in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\n",
      "cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's\n",
      "invitation--a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike\n",
      "himself--greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious\n",
      "design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some\n",
      "unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister. The\n",
      "distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious\n",
      "quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered\n",
      "what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n",
      "But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her\n",
      "sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the\n",
      "tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all\n",
      "probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and\n",
      "encouraging as a duty.\n",
      "In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\n",
      "red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\n",
      "\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\" said she,\n",
      "as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\"\n",
      "\"It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\n",
      "of a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\n",
      "affectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice,--gone too\n",
      "without intending to return! Something more than what he owned to us\n",
      "must have happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.\n",
      "_You_ must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can\n",
      "they have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness\n",
      "to accept your invitation here?\"\n",
      "\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\n",
      "_that._ He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all\n",
      "over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\n",
      "first seemed strange to me as well as to you.\"\n",
      "\"Can you, indeed!\"\n",
      "\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but\n",
      "you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy\n",
      "_you_, I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it. I am\n",
      "persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\n",
      "disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and\n",
      "on that account is eager to get him away; and that the business which\n",
      "she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss\n",
      "him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware\n",
      "that she _does_ disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at\n",
      "present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels\n",
      "himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her\n",
      "schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell\n",
      "me, I know, that this may or may _not_ have happened; but I will\n",
      "listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of\n",
      "understanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor,\n",
      "what have you to say?\"\n",
      "\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\n",
      "\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have\n",
      "happened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had\n",
      "rather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for\n",
      "misery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology\n",
      "for the latter. You are resolved to think him blamable, because he\n",
      "took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has\n",
      "shown. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits\n",
      "depressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be\n",
      "accepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to\n",
      "the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the\n",
      "world to think ill of?--to the possibility of motives unanswerable in\n",
      "themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all,\n",
      "what is it you suspect him of?\"\n",
      "\"I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is\n",
      "the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed\n",
      "in him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of\n",
      "the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\n",
      "candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have\n",
      "very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\n",
      "But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\n",
      "once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\n",
      "its being practiced by him.\"\n",
      "\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where\n",
      "the deviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of\n",
      "what I have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\n",
      "\"Not entirely. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they\n",
      "_are_ engaged) from Mrs. Smith; and if that is the case, it must be\n",
      "highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at\n",
      "present. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\n",
      "\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and\n",
      "Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have\n",
      "been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.\"\n",
      "\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor; \"but of their\n",
      "engagement I do.\"\n",
      "\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"\n",
      "\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has\n",
      "not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last\n",
      "fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future\n",
      "wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?\n",
      "Have we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been\n",
      "daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate\n",
      "respect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How\n",
      "could such a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that\n",
      "Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should\n",
      "leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of\n",
      "his affection,--that they should part without a mutual exchange of\n",
      "confidence?\"\n",
      "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance except _one_ is\n",
      "in favour of their engagement; but that _one_ is the total silence of\n",
      "both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\n",
      "\"How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,\n",
      "if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the\n",
      "nature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a\n",
      "part in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him\n",
      "really indifferent to her?\"\n",
      "\"No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure.\"\n",
      "\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such\n",
      "indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this\n",
      "matter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are\n",
      "fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. If we\n",
      "find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.\"\n",
      "\"A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you\n",
      "would suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I\n",
      "require no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to\n",
      "justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly\n",
      "open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister's wishes. It must be\n",
      "Willoughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of\n",
      "honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to\n",
      "create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"\n",
      "\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor. \"I love Willoughby,\n",
      "sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more\n",
      "painful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will\n",
      "not encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\n",
      "manners this morning; he did not speak like himself, and did not\n",
      "return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be\n",
      "explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He\n",
      "had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest\n",
      "affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.\n",
      "Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware\n",
      "that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away\n",
      "for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part\n",
      "by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a\n",
      "case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more\n",
      "to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general\n",
      "character;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct\n",
      "on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,\n",
      "or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.\"\n",
      "\"You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be\n",
      "suspected. Though _we_ have not known him long, he is no stranger in\n",
      "this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?\n",
      "Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\n",
      "it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging\n",
      "everything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an\n",
      "engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage\n",
      "must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it\n",
      "can be observed, may now be very advisable.\"\n",
      "They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then\n",
      "at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to\n",
      "acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.\n",
      "They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the\n",
      "room and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes\n",
      "were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then\n",
      "restrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could\n",
      "neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently\n",
      "pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of\n",
      "fortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.\n",
      "This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She\n",
      "was without any power, because she was without any desire of command\n",
      "over herself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\n",
      "overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most\n",
      "anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if\n",
      "they spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings\n",
      "connected with him.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able\n",
      "to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She\n",
      "would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next\n",
      "morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than\n",
      "when she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a\n",
      "disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the\n",
      "whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with a\n",
      "headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\n",
      "giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding\n",
      "all attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent\n",
      "enough!\n",
      "When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about\n",
      "the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment\n",
      "and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.\n",
      "The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She played\n",
      "over every favourite song that she had been used to play to\n",
      "Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined,\n",
      "and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had\n",
      "written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther\n",
      "sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day\n",
      "applied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing\n",
      "and crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books\n",
      "too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast\n",
      "between the past and present was certain of giving. She read nothing\n",
      "but what they had been used to read together.\n",
      "Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it\n",
      "sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these\n",
      "employments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and\n",
      "silent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as\n",
      "lively as ever.\n",
      "No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.\n",
      "Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at\n",
      "least satisfied herself.\n",
      "\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John fetches our\n",
      "letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already\n",
      "agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it\n",
      "could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through\n",
      "Sir John's hands.\"\n",
      "Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a\n",
      "motive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so\n",
      "direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real\n",
      "state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she\n",
      "could not help suggesting it to her mother.\n",
      "\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she, \"whether she is or\n",
      "she is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind,\n",
      "so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would\n",
      "be the natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all\n",
      "unreserve, and to you more especially.\"\n",
      "\"I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible\n",
      "that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry\n",
      "inflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never\n",
      "deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of\n",
      "what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know\n",
      "Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall\n",
      "not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances\n",
      "make the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the\n",
      "confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty\n",
      "would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.\"\n",
      "Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister's\n",
      "youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common\n",
      "care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic\n",
      "delicacy.\n",
      "It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned before\n",
      "Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed,\n",
      "were not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;\n",
      "but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of\n",
      "Shakespeare, exclaimed--\n",
      "\"We have never finished _Hamlet_, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went\n",
      "away before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he\n",
      "comes again--; But it may be months, perhaps, before _that_ happens.\"\n",
      "\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise. \"No--nor many weeks.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor\n",
      "pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of\n",
      "confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.\n",
      "One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was\n",
      "prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\n",
      "wandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\n",
      "companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the\n",
      "downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of\n",
      "the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never\n",
      "be found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the\n",
      "exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\n",
      "They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\n",
      "for Marianne's _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\n",
      "with gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the\n",
      "entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less\n",
      "wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had\n",
      "travelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching\n",
      "that point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\n",
      "which formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot\n",
      "which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before.\n",
      "Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated\n",
      "one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes\n",
      "they could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment\n",
      "afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed--\n",
      "\"It is he; it is indeed--I know it is!\" and was hastening to meet him,\n",
      "when Elinor cried out--\n",
      "\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The\n",
      "person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.\"\n",
      "\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has. His air, his\n",
      "coat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come.\"\n",
      "She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne\n",
      "from particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being\n",
      "Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon\n",
      "within thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart\n",
      "sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back,\n",
      "when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a\n",
      "third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging\n",
      "her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\n",
      "Edward Ferrars.\n",
      "He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be\n",
      "forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained\n",
      "a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_, and\n",
      "in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\n",
      "He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with\n",
      "them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.\n",
      "He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by\n",
      "Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him\n",
      "than even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between\n",
      "Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable\n",
      "coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual\n",
      "behaviour. On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\n",
      "of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was\n",
      "confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked\n",
      "neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by\n",
      "questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne\n",
      "saw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a\n",
      "dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her,\n",
      "by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\n",
      "contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\n",
      "After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries\n",
      "of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No,\n",
      "he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.\n",
      "\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the\n",
      "same county with Elinor without seeing her before.\n",
      "He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with\n",
      "some friends near Plymouth.\n",
      "\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\n",
      "\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks much as it always\n",
      "does at this time of the year--the woods and walks thickly covered\n",
      "with dead leaves.\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation have I\n",
      "formerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see\n",
      "them driven in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they,\n",
      "the season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard\n",
      "them. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven\n",
      "as much as possible from the sight.\"\n",
      "\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your passion for dead\n",
      "leaves.\"\n",
      "\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But\n",
      "_sometimes_ they are.\" As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a\n",
      "few moments; but rousing herself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she,\n",
      "calling his attention to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley. Look up\n",
      "to it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever\n",
      "see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and\n",
      "plantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that\n",
      "farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\n",
      "\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these bottoms must be\n",
      "dirty in winter.\"\n",
      "\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\n",
      "\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the objects before\n",
      "me, I see a very dirty lane.\"\n",
      "\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\n",
      "\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant\n",
      "people?\"\n",
      "\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not be more unfortunately\n",
      "situated.\"\n",
      "\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can you be so\n",
      "unjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards\n",
      "us have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne,\n",
      "how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many painful moments.\"\n",
      "Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their\n",
      "visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by\n",
      "talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting\n",
      "from him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve\n",
      "mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to\n",
      "regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present,\n",
      "she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated\n",
      "him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVII\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his\n",
      "coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.\n",
      "Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received\n",
      "the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\n",
      "stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he\n",
      "entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating\n",
      "manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love\n",
      "with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her;\n",
      "and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like\n",
      "himself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his\n",
      "interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in\n",
      "spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was\n",
      "attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family\n",
      "perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of\n",
      "liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\n",
      "selfish parents.\n",
      "\"What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?\" said she,\n",
      "when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; \"are you still\n",
      "to be a great orator in spite of yourself?\"\n",
      "\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents\n",
      "than inclination for a public life!\"\n",
      "\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to\n",
      "satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no\n",
      "affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find\n",
      "it a difficult matter.\"\n",
      "\"I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have\n",
      "every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced\n",
      "into genius and eloquence.\"\n",
      "\"You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate.\"\n",
      "\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as\n",
      "well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body\n",
      "else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.\"\n",
      "\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne. \"What have wealth or grandeur\n",
      "to do with happiness?\"\n",
      "\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth has much to do\n",
      "with it.\"\n",
      "\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only give happiness\n",
      "where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can\n",
      "afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come to the same point.\n",
      "_Your_ competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and\n",
      "without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\n",
      "kind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more\n",
      "noble than mine. Come, what is your competence?\"\n",
      "\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that._\"\n",
      "Elinor laughed. \"_Two_ thousand a year! _One_ is my wealth! I guessed\n",
      "how it would end.\"\n",
      "\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\" said\n",
      "Marianne. \"A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure\n",
      "I am not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of\n",
      "servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on\n",
      "less.\"\n",
      "Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their\n",
      "future expenses at Combe Magna.\n",
      "\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward; \"but why must you have hunters? Every body\n",
      "does not hunt.\"\n",
      "Marianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\n",
      "\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, \"that somebody\n",
      "would give us all a large fortune a-piece!\"\n",
      "\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with\n",
      "animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\" said Elinor, \"in spite\n",
      "of the insufficiency of wealth.\"\n",
      "\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be! I wonder what I\n",
      "should do with it!\"\n",
      "Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\n",
      "\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich without my help.\"\n",
      "\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\" observed Elinor,\n",
      "\"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\n",
      "\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,\"\n",
      "said Edward, \"in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,\n",
      "music-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a\n",
      "general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as\n",
      "for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music\n",
      "enough in London to content her. And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\n",
      "Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up\n",
      "every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;\n",
      "and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old\n",
      "twisted tree. Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very\n",
      "saucy. But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old\n",
      "disputes.\"\n",
      "\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy\n",
      "or gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking\n",
      "of former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be\n",
      "spent; some of it, at least--my loose cash--would certainly be\n",
      "employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\n",
      "\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the\n",
      "authors or their heirs.\"\n",
      "\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who\n",
      "wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever\n",
      "be in love more than once in their life--for your opinion on that\n",
      "point is unchanged, I presume?\"\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is\n",
      "not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.\"\n",
      "\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor, \"she is not\n",
      "at all altered.\"\n",
      "\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\n",
      "\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me. You are not\n",
      "very gay yourself.\"\n",
      "\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh. \"But gaiety never\n",
      "was a part of _my_ character.\"\n",
      "\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,\" said Elinor; \"I should\n",
      "hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all\n",
      "she does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but\n",
      "she is not often really merry.\"\n",
      "\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I have always set her\n",
      "down as a lively girl.\"\n",
      "\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\" said\n",
      "Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some point or\n",
      "other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or\n",
      "stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the\n",
      "deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of\n",
      "themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,\n",
      "without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\n",
      "\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"to be guided\n",
      "wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were\n",
      "given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has\n",
      "always been your doctrine, I am sure.\"\n",
      "\"No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of\n",
      "the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the\n",
      "behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess,\n",
      "of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with\n",
      "greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their\n",
      "sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?\"\n",
      "\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of\n",
      "general civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain no ground?\"\n",
      "\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor, looking expressively at\n",
      "Marianne.\n",
      "\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side of the question; but\n",
      "I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's. I never wish to\n",
      "offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I\n",
      "am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought\n",
      "that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I\n",
      "am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!\"\n",
      "\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,\" said\n",
      "Elinor.\n",
      "\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\" replied Edward.\n",
      "\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or\n",
      "other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy\n",
      "and graceful, I should not be shy.\"\n",
      "\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne, \"and that is worse.\"\n",
      "Edward started. \"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, very.\"\n",
      "\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring. \"Reserved!--how, in\n",
      "what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?\"\n",
      "Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the\n",
      "subject, she said to him, \"Do not you know my sister well enough to\n",
      "understand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one\n",
      "reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as\n",
      "rapturously as herself?\"\n",
      "Edward made no answer. His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him\n",
      "in their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.\n",
      "CHAPTER XVIII\n",
      "Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His\n",
      "visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own\n",
      "enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was\n",
      "unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still\n",
      "distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no\n",
      "doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference\n",
      "seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her\n",
      "contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the\n",
      "preceding one.\n",
      "He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning\n",
      "before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to\n",
      "promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to\n",
      "themselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour\n",
      "door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself\n",
      "come out.\n",
      "\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\" said he, \"as you are\n",
      "not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.\"\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding\n",
      "country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the\n",
      "valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher\n",
      "situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole,\n",
      "which had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured\n",
      "Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe her own\n",
      "admiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the\n",
      "objects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her\n",
      "by saying, \"You must not enquire too far, Marianne: remember I have no\n",
      "knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\n",
      "and want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep,\n",
      "which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to\n",
      "be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought\n",
      "only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\n",
      "You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I\n",
      "call it a very fine country,--the hills are steep, the woods seem full\n",
      "of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug,--with rich\n",
      "meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It\n",
      "exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty\n",
      "with utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you\n",
      "admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and\n",
      "promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\n",
      "I know nothing of the picturesque.\"\n",
      "\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne; \"but why should you\n",
      "boast of it?\"\n",
      "\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind of affectation,\n",
      "Edward here falls into another. Because he believes many people\n",
      "pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really\n",
      "feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater\n",
      "indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he\n",
      "possesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\n",
      "\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration of landscape\n",
      "scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries\n",
      "to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\n",
      "picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I\n",
      "have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to\n",
      "describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and\n",
      "meaning.\"\n",
      "\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel all the delight\n",
      "in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your\n",
      "sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine\n",
      "prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked,\n",
      "twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall,\n",
      "straight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I\n",
      "am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more\n",
      "pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower,--and a troop of\n",
      "tidy, happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the\n",
      "world.\"\n",
      "Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her\n",
      "sister. Elinor only laughed.\n",
      "The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained\n",
      "thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.\n",
      "She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a\n",
      "plait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\n",
      "\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried. \"Is that\n",
      "Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should\n",
      "have thought her hair had been darker.\"\n",
      "Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt; but when she saw\n",
      "how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of\n",
      "thought could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and\n",
      "giving a momentary glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister's\n",
      "hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.\"\n",
      "Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair\n",
      "was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;\n",
      "the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne\n",
      "considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\n",
      "have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\n",
      "She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and\n",
      "affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of\n",
      "something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every\n",
      "opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all\n",
      "doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.\n",
      "Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of\n",
      "mind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning.\n",
      "Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own\n",
      "forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little\n",
      "offence it had given her sister.\n",
      "Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the\n",
      "cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of\n",
      "his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name\n",
      "of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of\n",
      "raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of\n",
      "their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being\n",
      "immediately sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very\n",
      "significant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's\n",
      "instructions, extended.\n",
      "Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to\n",
      "dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.\n",
      "On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their\n",
      "visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,\n",
      "he wished to engage them for both.\n",
      "\"You _must_ drink tea with us to night,\" said he, \"for we shall be\n",
      "quite alone; and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we\n",
      "shall be a large party.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. \"And who knows but you may raise\n",
      "a dance,\" said she. \"And that will tempt _you_, Miss Marianne.\"\n",
      "\"A dance!\" cried Marianne. \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"\n",
      "\"Who? why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.\n",
      "What! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that\n",
      "shall be nameless is gone!\"\n",
      "\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John, \"that Willoughby were among\n",
      "us again.\"\n",
      "This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. \"And who\n",
      "is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he\n",
      "was sitting.\n",
      "She gave him a brief reply. Marianne's countenance was more\n",
      "communicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning\n",
      "of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him\n",
      "before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round\n",
      "her, and said, in a whisper, \"I have been guessing. Shall I tell you\n",
      "my guess?\"\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"Shall I tell you.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly.\"\n",
      "\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"\n",
      "Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at\n",
      "the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said--\n",
      "\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope--I am sure\n",
      "you will like him.\"\n",
      "\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness\n",
      "and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of\n",
      "her acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing\n",
      "between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to\n",
      "mention it.\n",
      "CHAPTER XIX\n",
      "Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on\n",
      "self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\n",
      "among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two\n",
      "or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he\n",
      "grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of\n",
      "going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly\n",
      "disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left\n",
      "them--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he\n",
      "could hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other\n",
      "things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the\n",
      "lie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being\n",
      "in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their\n",
      "kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being\n",
      "with them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of\n",
      "their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.\n",
      "Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\n",
      "mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose\n",
      "character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\n",
      "for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,\n",
      "and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain\n",
      "behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to\n",
      "regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous\n",
      "qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from\n",
      "her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of\n",
      "openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want\n",
      "of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's\n",
      "disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of\n",
      "his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered\n",
      "inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his\n",
      "mother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will,\n",
      "parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad\n",
      "to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to\n",
      "yield, when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty\n",
      "to be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for\n",
      "comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the\n",
      "remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from\n",
      "him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it\n",
      "which he constantly wore round his finger.\n",
      "\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the\n",
      "last morning, \"you would be a happier man if you had any profession to\n",
      "engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some\n",
      "inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would\n",
      "not be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you\n",
      "would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would\n",
      "know where to go when you left them.\"\n",
      "\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long thought on this\n",
      "point, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always\n",
      "be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to\n",
      "engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing\n",
      "like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of\n",
      "my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never\n",
      "could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the\n",
      "church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.\n",
      "They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The\n",
      "law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\n",
      "in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\n",
      "drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for\n",
      "the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family\n",
      "approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too\n",
      "old when the subject was first started to enter it; and, at length, as\n",
      "there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might\n",
      "be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one,\n",
      "idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and\n",
      "honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\n",
      "bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do\n",
      "nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle\n",
      "ever since.\"\n",
      "\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "\"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons\n",
      "will be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and\n",
      "trades as Columella's.\"\n",
      "\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent, \"to be as\n",
      "unlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in\n",
      "every thing.\"\n",
      "\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,\n",
      "Edward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike\n",
      "yourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from\n",
      "friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\n",
      "education or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but\n",
      "patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your\n",
      "mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so\n",
      "anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her\n",
      "happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\n",
      "How much may not a few months do?\"\n",
      "\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many months to produce any\n",
      "good to me.\"\n",
      "This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which\n",
      "shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's\n",
      "feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\n",
      "But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\n",
      "from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\n",
      "going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\n",
      "Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\n",
      "seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different\n",
      "as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.\n",
      "Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\n",
      "house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor\n",
      "avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost\n",
      "as much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this\n",
      "conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\n",
      "from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\n",
      "solicitude on her account.\n",
      "Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\n",
      "more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\n",
      "The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\n",
      "affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.\n",
      "That her sister's affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though\n",
      "she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she\n",
      "gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that\n",
      "sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.\n",
      "Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in\n",
      "determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to\n",
      "indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\n",
      "to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible\n",
      "variety which the different state of her spirits at different times\n",
      "could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and\n",
      "doubt. There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of\n",
      "her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\n",
      "conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude\n",
      "was produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could\n",
      "not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\n",
      "interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\n",
      "her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\n",
      "From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was\n",
      "roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival\n",
      "of company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little\n",
      "gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew\n",
      "her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\n",
      "door. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite\n",
      "unknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir\n",
      "John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\n",
      "knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to\n",
      "open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short\n",
      "between the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to\n",
      "speak at one without being heard at the other.\n",
      "\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers. How do you like\n",
      "them?\"\n",
      "\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\n",
      "\"Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very\n",
      "pretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.\"\n",
      "As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without\n",
      "taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.\n",
      "\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her\n",
      "instrument is open.\"\n",
      "\"She is walking, I believe.\"\n",
      "They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to\n",
      "wait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story. She came\n",
      "hallooing to the window, \"How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be\n",
      "glad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son\n",
      "and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I\n",
      "thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\n",
      "but it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of\n",
      "nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again;\n",
      "so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is\n",
      "Colonel Brandon come back again--\"\n",
      "Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to\n",
      "receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two\n",
      "strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same\n",
      "time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into\n",
      "the parlour, attended by Sir John.\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally\n",
      "unlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very\n",
      "pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\n",
      "possibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,\n",
      "but they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile,\n",
      "smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled\n",
      "when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five\n",
      "or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his\n",
      "wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the\n",
      "room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies,\n",
      "without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\n",
      "apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\n",
      "it as long as he stayed.\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with\n",
      "a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before\n",
      "her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.\n",
      "\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so\n",
      "charming! Only think, Mamma, how it is improved since I was here last!\n",
      "I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how\n",
      "delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!\n",
      "Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\n",
      "Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from\n",
      "the newspaper.\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing; \"he never does\n",
      "sometimes. It is so ridiculous!\"\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to\n",
      "find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking\n",
      "with surprise at them both.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and\n",
      "continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\n",
      "their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer\n",
      "laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\n",
      "body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an\n",
      "agreeable surprise.\n",
      "\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\" added Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice\n",
      "as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on\n",
      "different sides of the room; \"but, however, I can't help wishing they\n",
      "had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,\n",
      "for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\n",
      "you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\n",
      "wrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\n",
      "morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you\n",
      "all!\"\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.\n",
      "\"She expects to be confined in February,\" continued Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and\n",
      "therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in\n",
      "the paper.\n",
      "\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\n",
      "\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John. \"Now, Palmer, you shall see a\n",
      "monstrous pretty girl.\"\n",
      "He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and\n",
      "ushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she\n",
      "appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\n",
      "heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer\n",
      "looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\n",
      "then returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by\n",
      "the drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.\n",
      "\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look,\n",
      "mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at\n",
      "them for ever.\" And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that\n",
      "there were any such things in the room.\n",
      "When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down\n",
      "the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.\n",
      "\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\n",
      "He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the\n",
      "room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.\n",
      "He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.\n",
      "Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at\n",
      "the park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not choose to dine with them oftener\n",
      "than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\n",
      "her daughters might do as they pleased. But they had no curiosity to\n",
      "see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\n",
      "pleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,\n",
      "likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\n",
      "likely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage\n",
      "should be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though\n",
      "she did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\n",
      "Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a\n",
      "family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.\n",
      "\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.\n",
      "\"The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very\n",
      "hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying\n",
      "either with them, or with us.\"\n",
      "\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\" said Elinor, \"by\n",
      "these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them\n",
      "a few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are\n",
      "grown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER XX\n",
      "As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next\n",
      "day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as\n",
      "good humoured and merry as before. She took them all most\n",
      "affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself between Elinor\n",
      "and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,\n",
      "which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must\n",
      "go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a\n",
      "sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the\n",
      "carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\n",
      "would go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any\n",
      "thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet\n",
      "again in town very soon, I hope.\"\n",
      "They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\n",
      "\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, \"I shall be quite\n",
      "disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in world for\n",
      "you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am\n",
      "sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am\n",
      "confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.\"\n",
      "They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.\n",
      "\"Oh, my love,\" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered\n",
      "the room--\"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to\n",
      "town this winter.\"\n",
      "Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies,\n",
      "began complaining of the weather.\n",
      "\"How horrid all this is!\" said he. \"Such weather makes every thing and\n",
      "every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as\n",
      "without, by rain. It makes one detest all one's acquaintance. What the\n",
      "devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?\n",
      "How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the\n",
      "weather.\"\n",
      "The rest of the company soon dropt in.\n",
      "\"I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\" said Sir John, \"you have not been able\n",
      "to take your usual walk to Allenham today.\"\n",
      "Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.\n",
      "\"Oh, don't be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer; \"for we know all\n",
      "about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think\n",
      "he is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the\n",
      "country, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\n",
      "\"Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but\n",
      "they say it is a sweet pretty place.\"\n",
      "\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\" said Mr. Palmer.\n",
      "Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed\n",
      "her interest in what was said.\n",
      "\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it must be some other\n",
      "place that is so pretty I suppose.\"\n",
      "When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with\n",
      "regret that they were only eight all together.\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking that we should\n",
      "be so few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?\"\n",
      "\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,\n",
      "that it could not be done? They dined with us last.\"\n",
      "\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"should not stand upon such\n",
      "ceremony.\"\n",
      "\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.\n",
      "\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife with her usual\n",
      "laugh. \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"\n",
      "\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother\n",
      "ill-bred.\"\n",
      "\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured old lady,\n",
      "\"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back\n",
      "again. So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\n",
      "Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid\n",
      "of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,\n",
      "as they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more\n",
      "thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.\n",
      "Palmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her\n",
      "husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was\n",
      "highly diverted.\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. \"He is\n",
      "always out of humour.\"\n",
      "Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him\n",
      "credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred\n",
      "as he wished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by\n",
      "finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\n",
      "bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\n",
      "woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any\n",
      "sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of\n",
      "distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment\n",
      "of every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was\n",
      "the desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too\n",
      "common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by\n",
      "establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to\n",
      "attach any one to him except his wife.\n",
      "\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, \"I have\n",
      "got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and\n",
      "spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,--and come\n",
      "while the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!\n",
      "It will be quite delightful!--My love,\" applying to her husband,\n",
      "\"don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came into Devonshire with no\n",
      "other view.\"\n",
      "\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you\n",
      "cannot refuse to come.\"\n",
      "They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\n",
      "\"But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all\n",
      "things. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.\n",
      "You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay\n",
      "now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\n",
      "against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I\n",
      "never saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very\n",
      "fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.\"\n",
      "Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the\n",
      "hardship of such an obligation.\n",
      "\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he is in\n",
      "Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to\n",
      "see all his letters directed to him with an M.P. But do you know, he\n",
      "says, he will never frank for me? He declares he won't. Don't you, Mr.\n",
      "Palmer?\"\n",
      "Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.\n",
      "\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued; \"he says it is\n",
      "quite shocking.\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational. Don't palm all\n",
      "your abuses of languages upon me.\"\n",
      "\"There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him!\n",
      "Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he\n",
      "comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\n",
      "She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,\n",
      "by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\n",
      "\"Well--I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant;\n",
      "and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can\n",
      "tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't\n",
      "come to Cleveland. I can't imagine why you should object to it.\"\n",
      "Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing\n",
      "the subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable\n",
      "that as they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to\n",
      "give some more particular account of Willoughby's general character,\n",
      "than could be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with\n",
      "him; and she was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of\n",
      "his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She\n",
      "began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\n",
      "and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\n",
      "\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\" replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not\n",
      "that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in\n",
      "town. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while\n",
      "he was at Allenham. Mama saw him here once before, but I was with my\n",
      "uncle at Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great\n",
      "deal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily\n",
      "that we should never have been in the country together. He is very\n",
      "little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do\n",
      "not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you\n",
      "know, and besides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about\n",
      "him, very well; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of\n",
      "it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much more of the matter than\n",
      "I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.\"\n",
      "\"Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body\n",
      "talks of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.\"\n",
      "\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\n",
      "\"Upon my honour I did. I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in\n",
      "Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.\"\n",
      "\"You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you\n",
      "must be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not\n",
      "be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect\n",
      "Colonel Brandon to do.\"\n",
      "\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how\n",
      "it happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and\n",
      "so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and\n",
      "another, and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family come\n",
      "to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very\n",
      "pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "of Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you\n",
      "have been in Devonshire so lately.'\"\n",
      "\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\n",
      "\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true,\n",
      "so from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite\n",
      "delightful, I declare! When is it to take place?\"\n",
      "\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but\n",
      "say fine things of you.\"\n",
      "\"I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I\n",
      "think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\n",
      "\"So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should\n",
      "be so grave and so dull. Mamma says _he_ was in love with your sister\n",
      "too. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly\n",
      "ever falls in love with any body.\"\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?\" said\n",
      "Elinor.\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are\n",
      "acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all\n",
      "think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She\n",
      "is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he\n",
      "is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and\n",
      "agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don't\n",
      "think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think\n",
      "you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,\n",
      "though we could not get him to own it last night.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material;\n",
      "but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.\n",
      "\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\" continued Charlotte.\n",
      "\"And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can't think how\n",
      "much I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at\n",
      "the cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your\n",
      "sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at\n",
      "Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts.\"\n",
      "\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular\n",
      "friend of Sir John's. I believe,\" she added in a low voice, \"he would\n",
      "have been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady\n",
      "Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good\n",
      "enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the\n",
      "Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.\"\n",
      "\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your mother\n",
      "before it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have\n",
      "liked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it\n",
      "was before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr.\n",
      "Palmer is the kind of man I like.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER XXI\n",
      "The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families\n",
      "at Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not\n",
      "last long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head,\n",
      "had hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a\n",
      "cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at\n",
      "the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and\n",
      "wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause\n",
      "of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and\n",
      "observe.\n",
      "In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young\n",
      "ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be\n",
      "her relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them\n",
      "directly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter\n",
      "were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such\n",
      "an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on\n",
      "the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\n",
      "visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\n",
      "elegance--whose tolerable gentility even--she could have no proof; for\n",
      "the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\n",
      "nothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the\n",
      "worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore\n",
      "unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\n",
      "their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\n",
      "up with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\n",
      "their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\n",
      "all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with\n",
      "merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or\n",
      "six times every day.\n",
      "The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel\n",
      "or unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very\n",
      "civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the\n",
      "furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that\n",
      "Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they\n",
      "had been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable\n",
      "girls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir\n",
      "John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise,\n",
      "and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of\n",
      "the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the\n",
      "sweetest girls in the world. From such commendation as this, however,\n",
      "there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest\n",
      "girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under\n",
      "every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir\n",
      "John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at\n",
      "his guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even\n",
      "to keep a third cousin to himself.\n",
      "\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I declare you shall\n",
      "come--You can't think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous\n",
      "pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all\n",
      "hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they\n",
      "both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that\n",
      "you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told\n",
      "them it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted\n",
      "with them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of\n",
      "playthings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come?\n",
      "Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. _You_ are my\n",
      "cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must be related.\"\n",
      "But Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of\n",
      "their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\n",
      "amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\n",
      "attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of\n",
      "the Miss Steeles to them.\n",
      "When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to\n",
      "these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the\n",
      "eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible\n",
      "face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two\n",
      "or three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\n",
      "features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness\n",
      "of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave\n",
      "distinction to her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and\n",
      "Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw\n",
      "with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves\n",
      "agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual\n",
      "raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\n",
      "their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the\n",
      "importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in\n",
      "admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be\n",
      "doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in\n",
      "which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing\n",
      "delight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such\n",
      "foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children,\n",
      "the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous;\n",
      "her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the\n",
      "excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her\n",
      "offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest\n",
      "surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the\n",
      "impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins\n",
      "submitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their\n",
      "ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen\n",
      "away, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It\n",
      "suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit\n",
      "so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.\n",
      "\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his taking Miss Steele's\n",
      "pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--\"He is full of\n",
      "monkey tricks.\"\n",
      "And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the\n",
      "same lady's fingers, she fondly observed, \"How playful William is!\"\n",
      "\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added, tenderly caressing\n",
      "a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the\n",
      "last two minutes; \"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was\n",
      "there such a quiet little thing!\"\n",
      "But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's\n",
      "head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this\n",
      "pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone\n",
      "by any creature professedly noisy. The mother's consternation was\n",
      "excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\n",
      "every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\n",
      "affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\n",
      "sufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, her\n",
      "wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\n",
      "on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\n",
      "the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\n",
      "cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\n",
      "brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings\n",
      "were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a\n",
      "scene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\n",
      "successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\n",
      "proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\n",
      "screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\n",
      "it would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in\n",
      "her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys\n",
      "chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay\n",
      "behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room\n",
      "had not known for many hours.\n",
      "\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.\n",
      "\"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\n",
      "\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it had been under\n",
      "totally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of\n",
      "heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in\n",
      "reality.\"\n",
      "\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\n",
      "Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not\n",
      "feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the\n",
      "whole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.\n",
      "She did her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton\n",
      "with more warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.\n",
      "\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister, \"what a charming man he\n",
      "is!\"\n",
      "Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just,\n",
      "came in without any Èclat. She merely observed that he was perfectly\n",
      "good humoured and friendly.\n",
      "\"And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine\n",
      "children in my life. I declare I quite doat upon them already, and\n",
      "indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.\"\n",
      "\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile, \"from what I have\n",
      "witnessed this morning.\"\n",
      "\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little Middletons rather\n",
      "too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it\n",
      "is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see\n",
      "children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame\n",
      "and quiet.\"\n",
      "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at Barton Park, I never\n",
      "think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.\"\n",
      "A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss\n",
      "Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now\n",
      "said rather abruptly, \"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?\n",
      "I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\n",
      "In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of\n",
      "the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.\n",
      "\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\" added Miss\n",
      "Steele.\n",
      "\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\" said Lucy, who seemed\n",
      "to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.\n",
      "\"I think every one _must_ admire it,\" replied Elinor, \"who ever saw\n",
      "the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate\n",
      "its beauties as we do.\"\n",
      "\"And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so\n",
      "many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast\n",
      "addition always.\"\n",
      "\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,\n",
      "\"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as\n",
      "Sussex?\"\n",
      "\"Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't. I'm\n",
      "sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how\n",
      "could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was\n",
      "only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they\n",
      "had not so many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may\n",
      "not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with\n",
      "them. For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they\n",
      "dress smart and behave civil. But I can't bear to see them dirty and\n",
      "nasty. Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\n",
      "quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but\n",
      "meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen. I suppose your\n",
      "brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was\n",
      "so rich?\"\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you, for I do not\n",
      "perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that\n",
      "if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is\n",
      "not the smallest alteration in him.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being beaux--they have\n",
      "something else to do.\"\n",
      "\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of nothing but\n",
      "beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing\n",
      "else.\" And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house\n",
      "and the furniture.\n",
      "This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. The vulgar freedom and\n",
      "folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not\n",
      "blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want\n",
      "of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish\n",
      "of knowing them better.\n",
      "Not so the Miss Steeles. They came from Exeter, well provided with\n",
      "admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his\n",
      "relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair\n",
      "cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,\n",
      "accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\n",
      "they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be\n",
      "better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable\n",
      "lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,\n",
      "their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of\n",
      "intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or\n",
      "two together in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no\n",
      "more; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together\n",
      "was, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes\n",
      "for their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\n",
      "established friends.\n",
      "To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their\n",
      "unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew\n",
      "or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate\n",
      "particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the\n",
      "eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as\n",
      "to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.\n",
      "\"'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,\" said\n",
      "she, \"and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I\n",
      "hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may\n",
      "have a friend in the corner already.\"\n",
      "Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in\n",
      "proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been\n",
      "with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of\n",
      "the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since\n",
      "Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to\n",
      "her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and\n",
      "winks, as to excite general attention. The letter F had been likewise\n",
      "invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless\n",
      "jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had\n",
      "been long established with Elinor.\n",
      "The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these\n",
      "jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the\n",
      "name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently\n",
      "expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\n",
      "into the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport long\n",
      "with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as\n",
      "much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.\n",
      "\"His name is Ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper; \"but pray\n",
      "do not tell it, for it's a great secret.\"\n",
      "\"Ferrars!\" repeated Miss Steele; \"Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?\n",
      "What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable\n",
      "young man to be sure; I know him very well.\"\n",
      "\"How can you say so, Anne?\" cried Lucy, who generally made an\n",
      "amendment to all her sister's assertions. \"Though we have seen him\n",
      "once or twice at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know\n",
      "him very well.\"\n",
      "Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. \"And who was this\n",
      "uncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?\" She wished very\n",
      "much to have the subject continued, though she did not choose to join\n",
      "in it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\n",
      "in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity\n",
      "after petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The\n",
      "manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her\n",
      "curiosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and\n",
      "suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to\n",
      "know something to his disadvantage. But her curiosity was unavailing,\n",
      "for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele\n",
      "when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXII\n",
      "Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like\n",
      "impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of\n",
      "taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from\n",
      "the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to\n",
      "encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her\n",
      "behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on\n",
      "their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself\n",
      "which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of\n",
      "Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of\n",
      "striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank\n",
      "communication of her sentiments.\n",
      "Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing;\n",
      "and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her\n",
      "agreeable; but her powers had received no aid from education: she was\n",
      "ignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\n",
      "her want of information in the most common particulars, could not be\n",
      "concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to\n",
      "appear to advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of\n",
      "abilities which education might have rendered so respectable; but she\n",
      "saw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\n",
      "of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\n",
      "assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have\n",
      "no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined\n",
      "insincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their\n",
      "meeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward\n",
      "others made every show of attention and deference towards herself\n",
      "perfectly valueless.\n",
      "\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\" said Lucy to her\n",
      "one day, as they were walking together from the park to the\n",
      "cottage--\"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your\n",
      "sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?\"\n",
      "Elinor _did_ think the question a very odd one, and her countenance\n",
      "expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I thought you must have\n",
      "seen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what\n",
      "sort of a woman she is?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward's\n",
      "mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent\n",
      "curiosity; \"I know nothing of her.\"\n",
      "\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such\n",
      "a way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; \"but\n",
      "perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I\n",
      "hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be\n",
      "impertinent.\"\n",
      "Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in\n",
      "silence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by\n",
      "saying, with some hesitation--\n",
      "\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I\n",
      "would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person\n",
      "whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I\n",
      "should not have the smallest fear of trusting _you_; indeed, I should\n",
      "be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable\n",
      "situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble\n",
      "_you._ I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry I do _not_,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment, \"if it\n",
      "could be of any use to _you_ to know my opinion of her. But really I\n",
      "never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and\n",
      "therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry\n",
      "into her character.\"\n",
      "\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But\n",
      "if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time _may_\n",
      "come--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be\n",
      "very intimately connected.\"\n",
      "She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side\n",
      "glance at her companion to observe its effect on her.\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean? Are you acquainted\n",
      "with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?\" And she did not feel much\n",
      "delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. _Robert_ Ferrars--I never saw him in\n",
      "my life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor, \"to his eldest brother.\"\n",
      "What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as\n",
      "painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the\n",
      "assertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\n",
      "unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and\n",
      "though her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt\n",
      "in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\n",
      "\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy; \"for to be sure you could\n",
      "have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the\n",
      "smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was\n",
      "always meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\n",
      "kept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it\n",
      "but Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not\n",
      "felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I\n",
      "really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not\n",
      "think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted\n",
      "you, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all\n",
      "your family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods\n",
      "quite as his own sisters.\"--She paused.\n",
      "Elinor for a few moments remained silent. Her astonishment at what she\n",
      "heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself\n",
      "to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\n",
      "which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\"May I ask\n",
      "if your engagement is of long standing?\"\n",
      "\"We have been engaged these four years.\"\n",
      "\"Four years!\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.\n",
      "\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even acquainted till the\n",
      "other day.\"\n",
      "\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my\n",
      "uncle's care, you know, a considerable while.\"\n",
      "\"Your uncle!\"\n",
      "\"Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?\"\n",
      "\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which\n",
      "increased with her increase of emotion.\n",
      "\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near\n",
      "Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me\n",
      "was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\n",
      "formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\n",
      "was almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter\n",
      "into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\n",
      "his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\n",
      "prudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as\n",
      "me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he\n",
      "is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\n",
      "a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's\n",
      "honour and love, and her companion's falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\n",
      "Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,\n",
      "that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake\n",
      "of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling. \"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the\n",
      "eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your\n",
      "sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must\n",
      "allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on\n",
      "who all my happiness depends.\"\n",
      "\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, \"that I\n",
      "should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\n",
      "\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has\n",
      "been to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,\n",
      "and, therefore, there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my\n",
      "name to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister's\n",
      "suspecting any thing, _that_ was reason enough for his not mentioning\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "She was silent. Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did not\n",
      "sink with it.\n",
      "\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she with a firm voice.\n",
      "\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor\n",
      "Edward! It puts him quite out of heart.\" Then taking a small miniature\n",
      "from her pocket, she added, \"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be\n",
      "so good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be\n",
      "sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was\n",
      "drew for. I have had it above these three years.\"\n",
      "She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\n",
      "painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\n",
      "her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind,\n",
      "she could have none of its being Edward's face. She returned it almost\n",
      "instantly, acknowledging the likeness.\n",
      "\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give him my picture in\n",
      "return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so\n",
      "anxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first\n",
      "opportunity.\"\n",
      "\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly. They then\n",
      "proceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world of your\n",
      "faithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what\n",
      "importance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she\n",
      "would never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I\n",
      "fancy she is an exceeding proud woman.\"\n",
      "\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor; \"but you do\n",
      "me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your\n",
      "secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\n",
      "unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being\n",
      "acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\n",
      "As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\n",
      "something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\n",
      "part of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no\n",
      "change.\n",
      "\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,\"\n",
      "said she, \"in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be\n",
      "sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\n",
      "description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as\n",
      "if you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really\n",
      "thought some explanation was due to you after my making such\n",
      "particular inquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate,\n",
      "that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only\n",
      "person that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she\n",
      "does me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of\n",
      "her betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you\n",
      "must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world\n",
      "t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\n",
      "should out with it all. You can't think how much I go through in my\n",
      "mind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I\n",
      "have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years. Every thing in\n",
      "such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly\n",
      "meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite\n",
      "broke.\"\n",
      "Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very\n",
      "compassionate.\n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, \"I think whether\n",
      "it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.\"\n",
      "As she said this, she looked directly at her companion. \"But then at\n",
      "other times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the\n",
      "thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of\n",
      "such a thing would do. And on my own account too--so dear as he is to\n",
      "me--I don't think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to\n",
      "do in such a case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?\"\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question; \"but I can give\n",
      "you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both\n",
      "sides, \"his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor\n",
      "Edward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful\n",
      "low-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left\n",
      "us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him\n",
      "quite ill.\"\n",
      "\"Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he\n",
      "came directly from town?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh\n",
      "circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; \"I remember he told us,\n",
      "that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\n",
      "She remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning\n",
      "nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect\n",
      "even to their names.\n",
      "\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\" repeated Lucy.\n",
      "\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\n",
      "\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was\n",
      "the matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more\n",
      "than a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor\n",
      "fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes\n",
      "in wretched spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;\"\n",
      "taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction\n",
      "to Elinor. \"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but\n",
      "that is not written so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he\n",
      "had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible.\"\n",
      "Elinor saw that it _was_ his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This\n",
      "picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been\n",
      "accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a\n",
      "correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a\n",
      "positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few\n",
      "moments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she\n",
      "could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she\n",
      "struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that\n",
      "her success was speedy, and for the time complete.\n",
      "\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the letter into her\n",
      "pocket, \"is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, I\n",
      "have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even\n",
      "_that._ If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave\n",
      "him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last,\n",
      "and that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.\n",
      "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?\"\n",
      "\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was\n",
      "concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt\n",
      "before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.\n",
      "Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the\n",
      "conversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a\n",
      "few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was\n",
      "then at liberty to think and be wretched.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIII\n",
      "However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,\n",
      "it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the\n",
      "present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of\n",
      "inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to\n",
      "be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt;\n",
      "supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and\n",
      "proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their\n",
      "opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation\n",
      "for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit\n",
      "near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at\n",
      "his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the\n",
      "intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family\n",
      "connections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,\n",
      "the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame\n",
      "every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact,\n",
      "which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. Her\n",
      "resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\n",
      "for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas,\n",
      "other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally\n",
      "deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?\n",
      "Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it\n",
      "might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His\n",
      "affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her\n",
      "mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her\n",
      "at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly\n",
      "loved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much\n",
      "could it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly\n",
      "blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence\n",
      "over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be\n",
      "defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured\n",
      "himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence\n",
      "had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived\n",
      "himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time\n",
      "regain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to? Could\n",
      "he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his\n",
      "affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his\n",
      "delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like\n",
      "her--illiterate, artful, and selfish?\n",
      "The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to\n",
      "every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding\n",
      "years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the\n",
      "understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,\n",
      "while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society\n",
      "and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity\n",
      "which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.\n",
      "If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his\n",
      "difficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were\n",
      "they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was\n",
      "undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune\n",
      "to herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated\n",
      "from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy\n",
      "was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family\n",
      "opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!\n",
      "As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she\n",
      "wept for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of\n",
      "having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by\n",
      "the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she\n",
      "thought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow,\n",
      "command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her\n",
      "mother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own\n",
      "expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after\n",
      "she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one\n",
      "would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor\n",
      "was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\n",
      "from the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling\n",
      "on the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly\n",
      "possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove\n",
      "near their house.\n",
      "The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had\n",
      "been entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to\n",
      "unceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. On the\n",
      "contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of\n",
      "what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from\n",
      "hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from\n",
      "the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more\n",
      "than she felt equal to support.\n",
      "From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive\n",
      "no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,\n",
      "while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their\n",
      "example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own\n",
      "good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,\n",
      "her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so\n",
      "poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.\n",
      "Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the\n",
      "subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for\n",
      "more reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their\n",
      "engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what\n",
      "Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her\n",
      "declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to\n",
      "convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her\n",
      "calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in\n",
      "it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary\n",
      "agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least\n",
      "doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very\n",
      "probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her\n",
      "praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to\n",
      "trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so\n",
      "confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking\n",
      "intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor\n",
      "remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\n",
      "Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\n",
      "natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very\n",
      "confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the\n",
      "affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of\n",
      "Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in\n",
      "future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her\n",
      "rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as\n",
      "every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own\n",
      "affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could\n",
      "not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her\n",
      "heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to\n",
      "hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust\n",
      "her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with\n",
      "composure.\n",
      "But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be\n",
      "commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take\n",
      "advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine\n",
      "enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most\n",
      "easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at\n",
      "least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly\n",
      "at the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of\n",
      "conversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or\n",
      "Lady Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever\n",
      "given for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.\n",
      "They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together,\n",
      "playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was\n",
      "sufficiently noisy.\n",
      "One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording\n",
      "Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at\n",
      "the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they\n",
      "would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to\n",
      "attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,\n",
      "except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a\n",
      "fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this\n",
      "was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\n",
      "and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united\n",
      "them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the\n",
      "invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally\n",
      "compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their\n",
      "parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\n",
      "seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\n",
      "The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from\n",
      "the frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the\n",
      "meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one\n",
      "novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less\n",
      "interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining\n",
      "parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied\n",
      "them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the\n",
      "impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They quitted\n",
      "it only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then\n",
      "placed, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\n",
      "entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They\n",
      "all rose up in preparation for a round game.\n",
      "\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy, \"you are not going to finish\n",
      "poor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must\n",
      "hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the\n",
      "dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and\n",
      "then I hope she will not much mind it.\"\n",
      "This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,\n",
      "\"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting\n",
      "to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have\n",
      "been at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel\n",
      "for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am\n",
      "resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\n",
      "\"You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes:--will you ring the\n",
      "bell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly\n",
      "disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for\n",
      "though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon\n",
      "having it done.\"\n",
      "Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with\n",
      "an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could\n",
      "taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt\n",
      "child.\n",
      "Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made\n",
      "any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the\n",
      "forms of general civility, exclaimed, \"Your Ladyship will have the\n",
      "goodness to excuse _me_--you know I detest cards. I shall go to the\n",
      "piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned.\" And without\n",
      "farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\n",
      "Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that _she_ had never\n",
      "made so rude a speech.\n",
      "\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; \"and I do not\n",
      "much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever\n",
      "heard.\"\n",
      "The remaining five were now to draw their cards.\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen to cut out, I may be\n",
      "of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and\n",
      "there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be\n",
      "impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I\n",
      "should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,\" cried\n",
      "Lucy, \"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there\n",
      "was; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria\n",
      "after all.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele. \"Dear little\n",
      "soul, how I do love her!\"\n",
      "\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor; \"and as you\n",
      "really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut\n",
      "in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?\"\n",
      "Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by\n",
      "a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to\n",
      "practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same\n",
      "time. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\n",
      "rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\n",
      "utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at\n",
      "which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\n",
      "by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\n",
      "was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\n",
      "safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\n",
      "subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIV\n",
      "In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\n",
      "\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,\n",
      "if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on\n",
      "its subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking the ice; you have set my\n",
      "heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended\n",
      "you by what I told you that Monday.\"\n",
      "\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\" and Elinor spoke\n",
      "it with the truest sincerity, \"nothing could be farther from my\n",
      "intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for\n",
      "the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\n",
      "\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of\n",
      "meaning, \"there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your\n",
      "manner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was\n",
      "angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for\n",
      "having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am\n",
      "very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not\n",
      "blame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my\n",
      "heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of\n",
      "my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am\n",
      "sure.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,\n",
      "to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall\n",
      "never have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one;\n",
      "you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have\n",
      "need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\n",
      "\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to\n",
      "marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every\n",
      "prospect of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very\n",
      "small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love\n",
      "him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all\n",
      "that his mother might give him if he married to please her. We must\n",
      "wait, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the\n",
      "world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and\n",
      "constancy nothing can deprive me of I know.\"\n",
      "\"That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly\n",
      "supported by the same trust in your's. If the strength of your\n",
      "reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under\n",
      "many circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement,\n",
      "your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\n",
      "Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her\n",
      "countenance from every expression that could give her words a\n",
      "suspicious tendency.\n",
      "\"Edward's love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty well put to the\n",
      "test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and\n",
      "it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt\n",
      "it now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm\n",
      "on that account from the first.\"\n",
      "Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.\n",
      "Lucy went on. \"I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from\n",
      "our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the\n",
      "world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for\n",
      "suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had\n",
      "been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or\n",
      "any lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had\n",
      "talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less\n",
      "happy at Longstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I am\n",
      "particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\n",
      "I am sure I could not be deceived.\"\n",
      "\"All this,\" thought Elinor, \"is very pretty; but it can impose upon\n",
      "neither of us.\"\n",
      "\"But what,\" said she after a short silence, \"are your views? or have\n",
      "you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a\n",
      "melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to\n",
      "this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in\n",
      "which it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure\n",
      "for a while by owning the truth?\"\n",
      "\"If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of\n",
      "anger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,\n",
      "and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my\n",
      "inclination for hasty measures.\"\n",
      "\"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness\n",
      "beyond reason.\"\n",
      "Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.\n",
      "\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor.\n",
      "\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his\n",
      "brother--silly and a great coxcomb.\"\n",
      "\"A great coxcomb!\" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those\n",
      "words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music. \"Oh, they are talking of\n",
      "their favourite beaux, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\"No sister,\" cried Lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux\n",
      "are _not_ great coxcombs.\"\n",
      "\"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "laughing heartily; \"for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved\n",
      "young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little\n",
      "creature, there is no finding out who _she_ likes.\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, \"I dare\n",
      "say Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss\n",
      "Dashwood's.\"\n",
      "Elinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked\n",
      "angrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy\n",
      "first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was\n",
      "then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent\n",
      "concerto--\n",
      "\"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my\n",
      "head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into\n",
      "the secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen\n",
      "enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\n",
      "other profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as\n",
      "he can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be\n",
      "kind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some\n",
      "regard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland\n",
      "living; which I understand is a very good one, and the present\n",
      "incumbent not likely to live a great while. That would be enough for\n",
      "us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.\"\n",
      "\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show any mark of my\n",
      "esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my\n",
      "interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is\n",
      "brother to Mrs. John Dashwood--_that_ must be recommendation enough to\n",
      "her husband.\"\n",
      "\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going into\n",
      "orders.\"\n",
      "\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.\"\n",
      "They were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with\n",
      "a deep sigh--\n",
      "\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at\n",
      "once by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties\n",
      "on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we\n",
      "should be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your\n",
      "advice, Miss Dashwood?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated\n",
      "feelings, \"on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well\n",
      "that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the\n",
      "side of your wishes.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great solemnity; \"I know\n",
      "nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do\n",
      "really believe, that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all\n",
      "means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be\n",
      "more for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing it\n",
      "immediately.\"\n",
      "Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and\n",
      "replied, \"This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving\n",
      "any opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence\n",
      "much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\n",
      "is too much for an indifferent person.\"\n",
      "\"'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy, with some\n",
      "pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, \"that your\n",
      "judgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be\n",
      "supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your\n",
      "opinion would not be worth having.\"\n",
      "Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might\n",
      "provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve;\n",
      "and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.\n",
      "Another pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this\n",
      "speech, and Lucy was still the first to end it.\n",
      "\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\" said she with all\n",
      "her accustomary complacency.\n",
      "\"Certainly not.\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other, while her eyes brightened\n",
      "at the information, \"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you\n",
      "there! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your\n",
      "brother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"\n",
      "\"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.\"\n",
      "\"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.\n",
      "Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who\n",
      "have been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go\n",
      "for the sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise\n",
      "London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"\n",
      "Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the\n",
      "first rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was\n",
      "therefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any\n",
      "reluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them\n",
      "dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down\n",
      "to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not\n",
      "only without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that\n",
      "he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which\n",
      "sincere affection on _her_ side would have given, for self-interest\n",
      "alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which\n",
      "she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.\n",
      "From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when\n",
      "entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing\n",
      "it, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her\n",
      "happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated\n",
      "by the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as\n",
      "civility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an\n",
      "indulgence which Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond\n",
      "what the first invitation implied. Their favour increased; they could\n",
      "not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of\n",
      "their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of\n",
      "the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which\n",
      "was in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to\n",
      "stay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due\n",
      "celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share\n",
      "of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXV\n",
      "Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of\n",
      "the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not\n",
      "without a settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her\n",
      "husband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the\n",
      "town, she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets\n",
      "near Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of\n",
      "January to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and\n",
      "very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to\n",
      "accompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her\n",
      "sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan,\n",
      "immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\n",
      "believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason\n",
      "alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at\n",
      "that time of the year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some\n",
      "surprise, and repeated her invitation immediately.\n",
      "\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_\n",
      "beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart\n",
      "upon it. Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I\n",
      "shan't put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be\n",
      "sending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford _that._ We three\n",
      "shall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\n",
      "if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always\n",
      "go with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to\n",
      "it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my\n",
      "hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of\n",
      "you; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have\n",
      "done with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for\n",
      "you to all the young men, you may depend upon it.\"\n",
      "\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne would not object\n",
      "to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very\n",
      "hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss\n",
      "Dashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for\n",
      "town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss\n",
      "Dashwood about it.\"\n",
      "\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of\n",
      "Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only\n",
      "the more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable\n",
      "for them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might\n",
      "talk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. But one\n",
      "or the other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do\n",
      "you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used\n",
      "till this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let\n",
      "us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her\n",
      "mind by and bye, why so much the better.\"\n",
      "\"I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you,\" said Marianne, with warmth:\n",
      "\"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give\n",
      "me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,\n",
      "to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I\n",
      "feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made\n",
      "less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should\n",
      "tempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare\n",
      "them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and\n",
      "saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by\n",
      "her eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\n",
      "opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother's\n",
      "decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any\n",
      "support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not\n",
      "approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had\n",
      "particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her\n",
      "mother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence\n",
      "the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which\n",
      "she had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared\n",
      "not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.\n",
      "That Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook\n",
      "every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be\n",
      "most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,\n",
      "was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object\n",
      "to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared\n",
      "to witness.\n",
      "On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that\n",
      "such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her\n",
      "daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to\n",
      "herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of\n",
      "their declining the offer upon _her_ account; insisted on their both\n",
      "accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual\n",
      "cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,\n",
      "from this separation.\n",
      "\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried, \"it is exactly what I could\n",
      "wish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.\n",
      "When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and\n",
      "happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret\n",
      "so improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of\n",
      "alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without\n",
      "any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you _should_ go to\n",
      "town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life\n",
      "acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be\n",
      "under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to\n",
      "you I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your\n",
      "brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,\n",
      "when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly\n",
      "estranged from each other.\"\n",
      "\"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\" said Elinor, \"you\n",
      "have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which\n",
      "occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,\n",
      "cannot be so easily removed.\"\n",
      "Marianne's countenance sunk.\n",
      "\"And what,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"is my dear prudent Elinor going to\n",
      "suggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do not\n",
      "let me hear a word about the expense of it.\"\n",
      "\"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or\n",
      "whose protection will give us consequence.\"\n",
      "\"That is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of her society,\n",
      "separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing\n",
      "at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady\n",
      "Middleton.\"\n",
      "\"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,\" said\n",
      "Marianne, \"at least it need not prevent _my_ accepting her invitation.\n",
      "I have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every\n",
      "unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.\"\n",
      "Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards\n",
      "the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in\n",
      "persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved\n",
      "within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go\n",
      "likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left\n",
      "to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should\n",
      "be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her\n",
      "domestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily\n",
      "reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,\n",
      "was not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without\n",
      "any unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.\n",
      "\"I will have you _both_ go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood; \"these objections are\n",
      "nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and\n",
      "especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to\n",
      "anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of\n",
      "sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\n",
      "acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family.\"\n",
      "Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her\n",
      "mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the\n",
      "shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on\n",
      "this attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to\n",
      "begin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward\n",
      "Ferrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the\n",
      "rest of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me,\n",
      "whether I am ever known to them or not.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in\n",
      "astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held\n",
      "her tongue.\n",
      "After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the\n",
      "invitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the\n",
      "information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness\n",
      "and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was\n",
      "delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of\n",
      "being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in\n",
      "London, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being\n",
      "delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as\n",
      "for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in\n",
      "their lives as this intelligence made them.\n",
      "Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with\n",
      "less reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,\n",
      "it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and\n",
      "when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her\n",
      "sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all\n",
      "her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she\n",
      "could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow\n",
      "herself to distrust the consequence.\n",
      "Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the\n",
      "perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her\n",
      "unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;\n",
      "and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\n",
      "Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one\n",
      "of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short\n",
      "of eternal.\n",
      "Their departure took place in the first week in January. The\n",
      "Middletons were to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their\n",
      "station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the\n",
      "family.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVI\n",
      "Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and\n",
      "beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,\n",
      "without wondering at her own situation, so short had their\n",
      "acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age\n",
      "and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a\n",
      "measure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with\n",
      "that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally\n",
      "shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every\n",
      "occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the\n",
      "rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and\n",
      "beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own\n",
      "prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and\n",
      "how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation\n",
      "to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of\n",
      "hope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what\n",
      "Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in\n",
      "town. Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on\n",
      "finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every\n",
      "new light as to his character which her own observation or the\n",
      "intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his\n",
      "behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain\n",
      "what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\n",
      "Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was\n",
      "determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be\n",
      "otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature--she must then\n",
      "learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which\n",
      "might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\n",
      "They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as\n",
      "they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\n",
      "companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in\n",
      "silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\n",
      "ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\n",
      "beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight\n",
      "exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct\n",
      "therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility\n",
      "which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\n",
      "whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both\n",
      "with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their\n",
      "ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them\n",
      "choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\n",
      "preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They\n",
      "reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released,\n",
      "after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to\n",
      "enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\n",
      "The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young\n",
      "ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable\n",
      "apartment. It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece\n",
      "still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof\n",
      "of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some\n",
      "effect.\n",
      "As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\n",
      "arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\n",
      "mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\n",
      "the same. \"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\n",
      "better defer your letter for a day or two?\"\n",
      "\"I am _not_ going to write to my mother,\" replied Marianne, hastily,\n",
      "and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more;\n",
      "it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\n",
      "and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\n",
      "mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\n",
      "engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\n",
      "pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n",
      "Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be\n",
      "no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\n",
      "eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\n",
      "direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\n",
      "bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter\n",
      "conveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\n",
      "which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\n",
      "agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\n",
      "dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\n",
      "anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\n",
      "It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being\n",
      "much engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.\n",
      "The tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been\n",
      "disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a\n",
      "loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any\n",
      "other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's\n",
      "approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every\n",
      "thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened\n",
      "the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening\n",
      "half a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a\n",
      "conviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy\n",
      "of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, \"Oh,\n",
      "Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed almost ready to\n",
      "throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.\n",
      "It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she\n",
      "immediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the\n",
      "same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her;\n",
      "and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister\n",
      "should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and\n",
      "disappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not\n",
      "unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the\n",
      "room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the\n",
      "recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\n",
      "\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\n",
      "Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\n",
      "head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to\n",
      "which she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour.\n",
      "He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\n",
      "himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\n",
      "his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries\n",
      "about their journey, and the friends they had left behind.\n",
      "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\n",
      "they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\n",
      "of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\n",
      "Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\n",
      "any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying\n",
      "something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen\n",
      "him last. \"Yes,\" he replied, with some embarrassment, \"almost ever\n",
      "since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it\n",
      "has never been in my power to return to Barton.\"\n",
      "This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\n",
      "her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\n",
      "the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and\n",
      "she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on\n",
      "the subject than she had ever felt.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon came in. \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she, with her usual\n",
      "noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not\n",
      "come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me\n",
      "a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have\n",
      "been at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things\n",
      "to do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had\n",
      "Cartwright to settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever\n",
      "since dinner! But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I\n",
      "should be in town today?\"\n",
      "\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been\n",
      "dining.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does\n",
      "Charlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.\"\n",
      "\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,\n",
      "that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two\n",
      "young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,\n",
      "but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which\n",
      "you will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be\n",
      "young and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very\n",
      "handsome--worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I\n",
      "don't know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has\n",
      "been dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you\n",
      "been to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come,\n",
      "let's have no secrets among friends.\"\n",
      "He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\n",
      "without satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and\n",
      "Marianne was obliged to appear again.\n",
      "After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\n",
      "than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to\n",
      "stay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were\n",
      "unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\n",
      "Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\n",
      "The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\n",
      "expectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished\n",
      "their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and\n",
      "in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\n",
      "them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\n",
      "from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at\n",
      "their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\n",
      "along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after\n",
      "having declined her own, though at the same time she would never have\n",
      "forgiven them if they had not come!\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\" said she; \"What do you think\n",
      "he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma? I forget what it was\n",
      "now, but it was something so droll!\"\n",
      "After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\n",
      "or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\n",
      "acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all\n",
      "accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\n",
      "which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\n",
      "some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it\n",
      "at first was induced to go likewise.\n",
      "Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond\n",
      "Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\n",
      "constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her\n",
      "mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\n",
      "from all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and\n",
      "dissatisfied every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of\n",
      "any article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both:\n",
      "she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\n",
      "home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the\n",
      "tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing\n",
      "pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on\n",
      "none, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision.\n",
      "It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner\n",
      "had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and\n",
      "when Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a\n",
      "sorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\" said she to\n",
      "the footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the\n",
      "negative. \"Are you quite sure of it?\" she replied. \"Are you certain\n",
      "that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?\"\n",
      "The man replied that none had.\n",
      "\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\n",
      "turned away to the window.\n",
      "\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her\n",
      "sister with uneasiness. \"If she had not known him to be in town she\n",
      "would not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to\n",
      "Combe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come\n",
      "nor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an\n",
      "engagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be\n",
      "carried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire;\n",
      "and how will _my_ interference be borne.\"\n",
      "She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances\n",
      "continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would\n",
      "represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some\n",
      "serious enquiry into the affair.\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate\n",
      "acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with\n",
      "them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\n",
      "engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\n",
      "for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she\n",
      "would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her\n",
      "own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure\n",
      "to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of\n",
      "expectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured\n",
      "for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she\n",
      "returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and\n",
      "forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to\n",
      "the window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVII\n",
      "\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings, when\n",
      "they met at breakfast the following morning, \"Sir John will not like\n",
      "leaving Barton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a\n",
      "day's pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem\n",
      "to take it so much to heart.\"\n",
      "\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to\n",
      "the window as she spoke, to examine the day. \"I had not thought of\n",
      "that. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.\"\n",
      "It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.\n",
      "\"It is charming weather for _them_ indeed,\" she continued, as she sat\n",
      "down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. \"How much they\n",
      "must enjoy it! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot be\n",
      "expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a\n",
      "series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts\n",
      "will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day\n",
      "or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,\n",
      "perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\n",
      "\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from\n",
      "seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, \"I dare say we\n",
      "shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next\n",
      "week.\"\n",
      "\"Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.\"\n",
      "\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will write to Combe by\n",
      "this day's post.\"\n",
      "But if she _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy\n",
      "which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the\n",
      "truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\n",
      "contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\n",
      "not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy\n",
      "in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation\n",
      "of a frost.\n",
      "The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and\n",
      "Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,\n",
      "watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the\n",
      "air.\n",
      "\"Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There\n",
      "seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm\n",
      "even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem\n",
      "parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\n",
      "clear afternoon.\"\n",
      "Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,\n",
      "and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning\n",
      "in the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of\n",
      "approaching frost.\n",
      "The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her\n",
      "behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her\n",
      "household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and\n",
      "excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret,\n",
      "she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction\n",
      "could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased\n",
      "to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she\n",
      "had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much\n",
      "real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at\n",
      "home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with\n",
      "them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,\n",
      "who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from\n",
      "any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much\n",
      "concern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a\n",
      "strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which\n",
      "he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than\n",
      "when at Barton.\n",
      "About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby\n",
      "was also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the\n",
      "morning's drive.\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while we were out.\"\n",
      "Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured\n",
      "to say, \"Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.\" But Marianne\n",
      "seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped\n",
      "with the precious card.\n",
      "This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those\n",
      "of her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From\n",
      "this moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him\n",
      "every hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on\n",
      "being left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.\n",
      "Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley\n",
      "Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when\n",
      "they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no\n",
      "second visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\n",
      "\"No, ma'am, for my mistress.\"\n",
      "But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\n",
      "\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\n",
      "\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor, unable to be longer\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\n",
      "After a short pause. \"You have no confidence in me, Marianne.\"\n",
      "\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from _you_--you who have confidence in no\n",
      "one!\"\n",
      "\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed, Marianne, I have\n",
      "nothing to tell.\"\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations then are\n",
      "alike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do\n",
      "not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.\"\n",
      "Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was\n",
      "not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to\n",
      "press for greater openness in Marianne.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it\n",
      "aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\n",
      "Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and\n",
      "cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John's part, and a\n",
      "violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.\n",
      "The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew\n",
      "near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that\n",
      "they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\n",
      "difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen\n",
      "nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for\n",
      "amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again\n",
      "in her absence.\n",
      "Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\n",
      "materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\n",
      "in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\n",
      "young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,\n",
      "however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an\n",
      "unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\n",
      "reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\n",
      "was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\n",
      "known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\n",
      "couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\n",
      "not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to\n",
      "avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and\n",
      "therefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on\n",
      "their entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\n",
      "who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side\n",
      "of the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she\n",
      "entered: it was enough--_he_ was not there--and she sat down, equally\n",
      "ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been\n",
      "assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though\n",
      "Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house,\n",
      "and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were\n",
      "to come.\n",
      "\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\n",
      "\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\n",
      "\"When do you go back again?\"\n",
      "\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\n",
      "Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was\n",
      "that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She\n",
      "complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason of all that very\n",
      "well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you\n",
      "would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very\n",
      "pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\n",
      "\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him\n",
      "somewhere in the street this morning.\" Marianne said no more, but\n",
      "looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing\n",
      "something that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to\n",
      "write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\n",
      "for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\n",
      "so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\n",
      "by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again\n",
      "writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other\n",
      "person.\n",
      "About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on\n",
      "business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too\n",
      "restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one\n",
      "window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\n",
      "Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all\n",
      "that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging\n",
      "her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an\n",
      "account of her real situation with respect to him.\n",
      "Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and\n",
      "Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the\n",
      "window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he\n",
      "entered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\n",
      "satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\n",
      "particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.\n",
      "Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\n",
      "sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the\n",
      "first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than\n",
      "once before, beginning with the observation of \"your sister looks\n",
      "unwell to-day,\" or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had\n",
      "appeared on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\n",
      "something particular about her. After a pause of several minutes,\n",
      "their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some\n",
      "agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a\n",
      "brother? Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no\n",
      "answer ready, was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient, of\n",
      "asking what he meant? He tried to smile as he replied, \"your sister's\n",
      "engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known.\"\n",
      "\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor, \"for her own family\n",
      "do not know it.\"\n",
      "He looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon, I am afraid my\n",
      "inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy\n",
      "intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally\n",
      "talked of.\"\n",
      "\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?\"\n",
      "\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you\n",
      "are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But\n",
      "still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps\n",
      "rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to\n",
      "support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\n",
      "accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in\n",
      "your sister's writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I\n",
      "could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it\n",
      "impossible to-? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of\n",
      "succeeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in\n",
      "saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I\n",
      "have the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely\n",
      "resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if\n",
      "concealment be possible, is all that remains.\"\n",
      "These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for\n",
      "her sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to\n",
      "say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated\n",
      "for a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The\n",
      "real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little\n",
      "known to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as\n",
      "liable to say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that\n",
      "Marianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and\n",
      "at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she\n",
      "thought it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say\n",
      "more than she really knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore,\n",
      "that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on\n",
      "which they stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no\n",
      "doubt, and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.\n",
      "He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,\n",
      "rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,\n",
      "\"to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\n",
      "may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\n",
      "Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to\n",
      "lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on\n",
      "the contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's\n",
      "unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her\n",
      "anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVIII\n",
      "Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor\n",
      "regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby\n",
      "neither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time\n",
      "to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept\n",
      "away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this\n",
      "party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and\n",
      "seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared,\n",
      "without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the\n",
      "drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's\n",
      "arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her\n",
      "attitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's\n",
      "presence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited\n",
      "for them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one\n",
      "was expected.\n",
      "They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as\n",
      "the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended\n",
      "the stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to\n",
      "another in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\n",
      "quite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their\n",
      "tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were\n",
      "permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and\n",
      "inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some\n",
      "time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to\n",
      "Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and\n",
      "Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great\n",
      "distance from the table.\n",
      "They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived\n",
      "Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest\n",
      "conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon\n",
      "caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to\n",
      "speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see\n",
      "her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor\n",
      "turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be\n",
      "unobserved by her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her\n",
      "whole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved\n",
      "towards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he is there--Oh! why does\n",
      "he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?\"\n",
      "\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do not betray what you\n",
      "feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\n",
      "This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be\n",
      "composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne,\n",
      "it was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which\n",
      "affected every feature.\n",
      "At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,\n",
      "and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to\n",
      "him. He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than\n",
      "Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\n",
      "observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed\n",
      "of all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a\n",
      "word. But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her\n",
      "face was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest\n",
      "emotion, \"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you\n",
      "not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?\"\n",
      "He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and\n",
      "he held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was\n",
      "evidently struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and\n",
      "saw its expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment's pause, he\n",
      "spoke with calmness.\n",
      "\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,\n",
      "and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find\n",
      "yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope.\"\n",
      "\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne in the wildest\n",
      "anxiety. \"Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake. What\n",
      "can be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell\n",
      "me, what is the matter?\"\n",
      "He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment\n",
      "returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom\n",
      "he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant\n",
      "exertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had\n",
      "the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town,\n",
      "which you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away with a\n",
      "slight bow and joined his friend.\n",
      "Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into\n",
      "her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried\n",
      "to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with\n",
      "lavender water.\n",
      "\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she could speak, \"and force\n",
      "him to come to me. Tell him I must see him again--must speak to him\n",
      "instantly. I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this\n",
      "is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him\n",
      "this moment.\"\n",
      "\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is\n",
      "not the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow.\"\n",
      "With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him\n",
      "herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at\n",
      "least, with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him\n",
      "with more privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne\n",
      "continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her\n",
      "feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw\n",
      "Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and\n",
      "telling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking\n",
      "to him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She\n",
      "instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them\n",
      "home, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer.\n",
      "Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed\n",
      "that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her\n",
      "wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they\n",
      "departed as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was\n",
      "spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a\n",
      "silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,\n",
      "where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon\n",
      "undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her\n",
      "sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past.\n",
      "That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and\n",
      "Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,\n",
      "seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own\n",
      "wishes, _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or\n",
      "misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of\n",
      "sentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been still\n",
      "stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which\n",
      "seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\n",
      "her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with\n",
      "the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that\n",
      "would bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and\n",
      "convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a\n",
      "regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.\n",
      "As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already\n",
      "have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her\n",
      "in its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest\n",
      "concern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\n",
      "could _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided\n",
      "in future, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance\n",
      "that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery\n",
      "of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and\n",
      "irreconcilable rupture with him.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIX\n",
      "Before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun\n",
      "gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne,\n",
      "only half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for\n",
      "the sake of all the little light she could command from it, and\n",
      "writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her. In this\n",
      "situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first\n",
      "perceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent\n",
      "anxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness--\n",
      "\"Marianne, may I ask--\"\n",
      "\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will soon know all.\"\n",
      "The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no\n",
      "longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return\n",
      "of the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could\n",
      "go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still\n",
      "obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of\n",
      "her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the\n",
      "last time to Willoughby.\n",
      "Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power;\n",
      "and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had\n",
      "not Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous\n",
      "irritability, not to speak to her for the world. In such\n",
      "circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long\n",
      "together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented\n",
      "her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but\n",
      "requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her\n",
      "wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of\n",
      "every body.\n",
      "At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and\n",
      "Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in\n",
      "pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to\n",
      "engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.\n",
      "As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a\n",
      "considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,\n",
      "round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to\n",
      "Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a\n",
      "death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as\n",
      "plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come\n",
      "from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her\n",
      "hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremor as\n",
      "made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. That\n",
      "good lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\n",
      "Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\n",
      "treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it\n",
      "to her liking. Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in\n",
      "measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and\n",
      "calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she\n",
      "said--\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my\n",
      "life! _My_ girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish\n",
      "enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I\n",
      "hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her waiting much\n",
      "longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.\n",
      "Pray, when are they to be married?\"\n",
      "Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,\n",
      "obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,\n",
      "trying to smile, replied, \"And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself\n",
      "into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I\n",
      "thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to\n",
      "imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive\n",
      "yourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me\n",
      "more than to hear of their being going to be married.\"\n",
      "\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don't we\n",
      "all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in\n",
      "love with each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see\n",
      "them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I\n",
      "know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding\n",
      "clothes? Come, come, this won't do. Because you are so sly about it\n",
      "yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such\n",
      "thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever\n",
      "so long. I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed, Ma'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously, \"you are mistaken.\n",
      "Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and\n",
      "you will find that you have though you will not believe me now.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,\n",
      "and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried\n",
      "away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne\n",
      "stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\n",
      "and two or three others laying by her. Elinor drew near, but without\n",
      "saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed\n",
      "her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of\n",
      "tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The\n",
      "latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of\n",
      "this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction,\n",
      "she put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her\n",
      "face with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who\n",
      "knew that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its\n",
      "course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\n",
      "spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read as\n",
      "follows:--\n",
      "\"Bond Street, January.\n",
      "\"MY DEAR MADAM,\n",
      "     \"I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for\n",
      "     which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. I am much\n",
      "     concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last\n",
      "     night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am\n",
      "     quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so\n",
      "     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of\n",
      "     what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional.\n",
      "     I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your\n",
      "     family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and\n",
      "     flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\n",
      "     misapprehension of my actions. My esteem for your whole\n",
      "     family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as\n",
      "     to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant to\n",
      "     express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more\n",
      "     guarded in my professions of that esteem. That I should ever\n",
      "     have meant more you will allow to be impossible, when you\n",
      "     understand that my affections have been long engaged\n",
      "     elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before\n",
      "     this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I\n",
      "     obey your commands in returning the letters with which I\n",
      "     have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you\n",
      "     so obligingly bestowed on me.\n",
      "I am, dear Madam,\n",
      "Your most obedient humble servant,\n",
      "\"JOHN WILLOUGHBY.\"\n",
      "With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss\n",
      "Dashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it\n",
      "must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their\n",
      "separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be\n",
      "suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby\n",
      "capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable\n",
      "and delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman,\n",
      "as to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of\n",
      "bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret,\n",
      "acknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection\n",
      "whatever;--a letter of which every line was an insult, and which\n",
      "proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.\n",
      "She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then\n",
      "read it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase\n",
      "her abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against\n",
      "him, that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\n",
      "Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss\n",
      "to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most\n",
      "irremediable of all evils,--a connection, for life, with an\n",
      "unprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most\n",
      "important.\n",
      "In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the\n",
      "depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the\n",
      "very different mind of a very different person, who had no other\n",
      "connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with\n",
      "every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her\n",
      "sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and\n",
      "so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on\n",
      "hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see\n",
      "who could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to\n",
      "perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been ordered\n",
      "till one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of\n",
      "contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse\n",
      "herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being\n",
      "indisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for\n",
      "its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing\n",
      "her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise\n",
      "from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from\n",
      "falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest\n",
      "and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\n",
      "nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no\n",
      "longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this\n",
      "was felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous\n",
      "faintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,\n",
      "made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some\n",
      "sense of her kindness, by saying, \"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\"I only wish,\" replied her sister, \"there were any thing I _could_ do,\n",
      "which might be of comfort to you.\"\n",
      "This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,\n",
      "who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, \"Oh! Elinor, I\n",
      "am miserable, indeed,\" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\n",
      "Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\"Exert yourself, dear Marianne,\" she cried, \"if you would not kill\n",
      "yourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her\n",
      "misery while _you_ suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot, I cannot,\" cried Marianne; \"leave me, leave me, if I\n",
      "distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so.\n",
      "Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of\n",
      "exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, _you_ cannot have an idea of what I\n",
      "suffer.\"\n",
      "\"Do you call _me_ happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew! And can you\n",
      "believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!\"\n",
      "\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" throwing her arms round her sister's neck;\n",
      "\"I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you\n",
      "are--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away\n",
      "such happiness as that?\"\n",
      "\"Many, many circumstances,\" said Elinor, solemnly.\n",
      "\"No, no, no,\" cried Marianne wildly, \"he loves you, and only you. You\n",
      "_can_ have no grief.\"\n",
      "\"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.\"\n",
      "\"And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing\n",
      "can do away.\"\n",
      "\"You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is\n",
      "your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you\n",
      "suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of\n",
      "his character had been delayed to a later period;--if your engagement\n",
      "had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,\n",
      "before he chose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy\n",
      "confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.\"\n",
      "\"Engagement!\" cried Marianne, \"there has been no engagement.\"\n",
      "\"No engagement!\"\n",
      "\"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith\n",
      "with me.\"\n",
      "\"But he told you that he loved you.\"\n",
      "\"Yes--no--never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never\n",
      "professedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never\n",
      "was.\"\n",
      "\"Yet you wrote to him?\"\n",
      "\"Yes: could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot\n",
      "talk.\"\n",
      "Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now\n",
      "raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the\n",
      "contents of all. The first, which was what her sister had sent him on\n",
      "their arrival in town, was to this effect:--\n",
      "\"Berkeley Street, January.\n",
      "     \"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this;\n",
      "     and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when\n",
      "     you know that I am in town. An opportunity of coming hither,\n",
      "     though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not\n",
      "     resist. I wish you may receive this in time to come here\n",
      "     tonight, but I will not depend on it. At any rate I shall\n",
      "     expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.\n",
      "M.D.\"\n",
      "Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance\n",
      "at the Middletons', was in these words:--\n",
      "     \"I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the\n",
      "     day before yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having\n",
      "     received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week\n",
      "     ago. I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more\n",
      "     to see you, every hour of the day. Pray call again as soon\n",
      "     as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected\n",
      "     this in vain. You had better come earlier another time,\n",
      "     because we are generally out by one. We were last night at\n",
      "     Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance. I have been told\n",
      "     that you were asked to be of the party. But could it be so?\n",
      "     You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if\n",
      "     that could be the case, and you not there. But I will not\n",
      "     suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your\n",
      "     personal assurance of its being otherwise.\n",
      "M.D.\"\n",
      "The contents of her last note to him were these:--\n",
      "     \"What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last\n",
      "     night? Again I demand an explanation of it. I was prepared\n",
      "     to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally\n",
      "     produced,--with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton\n",
      "     appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have\n",
      "     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct\n",
      "     which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though\n",
      "     I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for\n",
      "     your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your\n",
      "     justification of it. You have perhaps been misinformed, or\n",
      "     purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may\n",
      "     have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me what it is, explain\n",
      "     the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in\n",
      "     being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to be\n",
      "     obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am\n",
      "     to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed\n",
      "     you, that your regard for us all was insincere, that your\n",
      "     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be told\n",
      "     as soon as possible. My feelings are at present in a state\n",
      "     of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but certainty\n",
      "     on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. If your\n",
      "     sentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my\n",
      "     notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.\n",
      "M.D.\"\n",
      "That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have\n",
      "been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been\n",
      "unwilling to believe. But her condemnation of him did not blind her to\n",
      "the impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was\n",
      "silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such\n",
      "unsolicited proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,\n",
      "and most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving\n",
      "that she had finished the letters, observed to her that they contained\n",
      "nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation.\n",
      "\"I felt myself,\" she added, \"to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if\n",
      "the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.\"\n",
      "\"I can believe it,\" said Elinor; \"but unfortunately he did not feel\n",
      "the same.\"\n",
      "\"He _did_ feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it. I\n",
      "know he did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the\n",
      "blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear\n",
      "to him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can\n",
      "so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest\n",
      "supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his\n",
      "voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being\n",
      "together at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me\n",
      "that it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I\n",
      "ever forget his distress?\"\n",
      "For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had\n",
      "passed away, she added, in a firmer tone--\n",
      "\"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.\"\n",
      "\"Dearest Marianne, who but himself? By whom can he have been\n",
      "instigated?\"\n",
      "\"By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather\n",
      "believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me\n",
      "in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This\n",
      "woman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but\n",
      "your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to\n",
      "bely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I\n",
      "would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know\n",
      "so well?\"\n",
      "Elinor would not contend, and only replied, \"Whoever may have been so\n",
      "detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,\n",
      "my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\n",
      "innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a\n",
      "reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.\"\n",
      "\"No, no,\" cried Marianne, \"misery such as mine has no pride. I care\n",
      "not who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be\n",
      "open to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be\n",
      "proud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return\n",
      "mortification--but I cannot. I must feel--I must be wretched--and they\n",
      "are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.\"\n",
      "\"But for my mother's sake and mine--\"\n",
      "\"I would do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so\n",
      "miserable--oh! who can require it?\"\n",
      "Again they were both silent. Elinor was employed in walking\n",
      "thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,\n",
      "without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning\n",
      "objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the\n",
      "bed, with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up\n",
      "Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,\n",
      "exclaimed--\n",
      "\"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!\n",
      "Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he\n",
      "might have heard against me, ought he not to have suspended his\n",
      "belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power\n",
      "of clearing myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\n",
      "which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--that is unpardonable.\n",
      "Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh,\n",
      "barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\"\n",
      "\"No, Marianne, in no possible way.\"\n",
      "\"And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long\n",
      "it may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who\n",
      "is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young\n",
      "and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one:--he\n",
      "talked to me only of myself.\"\n",
      "Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended\n",
      "thus:--\n",
      "\"Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be\n",
      "gone to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\"To-morrow, Marianne!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake--and\n",
      "now who cares for me? Who regards me?\"\n",
      "\"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much\n",
      "more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent\n",
      "such a hasty removal as that.\"\n",
      "\"Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long,\n",
      "I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.\n",
      "The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity? The pity of\n",
      "such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would _he_ say to that!\"\n",
      "Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but\n",
      "no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body\n",
      "she moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more\n",
      "hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at\n",
      "all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for\n",
      "assistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length\n",
      "persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXX\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and\n",
      "without waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the\n",
      "door and walked in with a look of real concern.\n",
      "\"How do you do my dear?\" said she in a voice of great compassion to\n",
      "Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.\n",
      "\"How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she looks very bad. No\n",
      "wonder. Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon--a\n",
      "good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told\n",
      "me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend\n",
      "of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;\n",
      "and I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say\n",
      "is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance\n",
      "abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his\n",
      "heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I\n",
      "have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever I meet him\n",
      "again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a\n",
      "day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne--he is not the\n",
      "only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face\n",
      "you will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won't disturb her\n",
      "any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done\n",
      "with. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know,\n",
      "and that will amuse her.\"\n",
      "She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she\n",
      "supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.\n",
      "Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with\n",
      "them. Elinor even advised her against it. But \"no, she would go down;\n",
      "she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.\"\n",
      "Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,\n",
      "though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,\n",
      "said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\n",
      "while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into\n",
      "the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.\n",
      "When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was\n",
      "calmer than her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had\n",
      "she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged\n",
      "attentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but\n",
      "not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts\n",
      "preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.\n",
      "Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its\n",
      "effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous,\n",
      "made her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities,\n",
      "which her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good\n",
      "friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was\n",
      "due to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her\n",
      "therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a\n",
      "favourite child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have\n",
      "the best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy\n",
      "in the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the\n",
      "day. Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a\n",
      "check to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of\n",
      "sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. As soon, however, as the\n",
      "consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on\n",
      "Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of\n",
      "Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\n",
      "up and hurried out of the room.\n",
      "\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, \"how it\n",
      "grieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without\n",
      "finishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to\n",
      "do her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I\n",
      "would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to\n",
      "me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there\n",
      "is plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord\n",
      "bless you! they care no more about such things!\"\n",
      "\"The lady then,--Miss Grey I think you called her,--is very rich?\"\n",
      "\"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart,\n",
      "stylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very\n",
      "well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family\n",
      "are all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it\n",
      "won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No\n",
      "wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don't\n",
      "signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes\n",
      "love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to\n",
      "fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is\n",
      "ready to have him. Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let\n",
      "his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?\n",
      "I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till\n",
      "matters came round. But that won't do nowadays; nothing in the way\n",
      "of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.\"\n",
      "\"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be\n",
      "amiable?\"\n",
      "\"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her\n",
      "mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day\n",
      "Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison\n",
      "would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison\n",
      "could never agree.\"\n",
      "\"And who are the Ellisons?\"\n",
      "\"Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for\n",
      "herself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now,\" after pausing a\n",
      "moment, \"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan\n",
      "by herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it\n",
      "seems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by and by we shall have a\n",
      "few friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at?\n",
      "She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?\"\n",
      "\"Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,\n",
      "will not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I\n",
      "can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.\"\n",
      "\"Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own\n",
      "supper, and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and\n",
      "so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been\n",
      "hanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came\n",
      "today finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I\n",
      "would not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know,\n",
      "how should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but\n",
      "a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at\n",
      "about them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when\n",
      "they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in\n",
      "Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see\n",
      "them to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and\n",
      "Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest\n",
      "allusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature\n",
      "must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\n",
      "about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to\n",
      "myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my\n",
      "dear madam will easily believe.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear\n",
      "it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a\n",
      "word about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.\n",
      "No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very\n",
      "thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I\n",
      "certainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such\n",
      "things, the better, the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot. And what\n",
      "does talking ever do you know?\"\n",
      "\"In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many\n",
      "cases of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances\n",
      "which, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to\n",
      "become the public conversation. I must do _this_ justice to Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement with my sister.\"\n",
      "\"Law, my dear! Don't pretend to defend him. No positive engagement\n",
      "indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the\n",
      "very rooms they were to live in hereafter!\"\n",
      "Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press the subject farther,\n",
      "and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby's; since,\n",
      "though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the\n",
      "enforcement of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides,\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\n",
      "\"Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill wind, for it will be\n",
      "all the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye,\n",
      "that he will. Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer. Lord!\n",
      "how he'll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will\n",
      "be all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year\n",
      "without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I\n",
      "had forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and\n",
      "then what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;\n",
      "exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and\n",
      "conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered\n",
      "with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in\n",
      "one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were\n",
      "there! Then, there is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a\n",
      "very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;\n",
      "and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\n",
      "from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\n",
      "up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the\n",
      "carriages that pass along. Oh! 'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in\n",
      "the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. To my\n",
      "fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are\n",
      "forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour\n",
      "nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon\n",
      "as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we\n",
      "_can_ but put Willoughby out of her head!\"\n",
      "\"Ay, if we can do that, Ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"we shall do very well\n",
      "with or without Colonel Brandon.\" And then rising, she went away to\n",
      "join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,\n",
      "leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,\n",
      "till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.\n",
      "\"You had better leave me,\" was all the notice that her sister received\n",
      "from her.\n",
      "\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go to bed.\" But this,\n",
      "from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first\n",
      "refused to do. Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,\n",
      "however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her\n",
      "aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some\n",
      "quiet rest before she left her.\n",
      "In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected that I have\n",
      "some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was\n",
      "tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor\n",
      "husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old\n",
      "colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the\n",
      "world. Do take it to your sister.\"\n",
      "\"Dear Ma'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the\n",
      "complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good you are! But I have\n",
      "just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\n",
      "nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\n",
      "leave, I will drink the wine myself.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\n",
      "earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she\n",
      "swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a\n",
      "colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its\n",
      "healing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\n",
      "on herself as on her sister.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner\n",
      "of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied\n",
      "that he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short,\n",
      "that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his\n",
      "entrance, she walked across the room to the tea-table where Elinor\n",
      "presided, and whispered, \"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.\n",
      "He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\n",
      "He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's, and, with a look\n",
      "which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after\n",
      "her sister.\n",
      "\"Marianne is not well,\" said she. \"She has been indisposed all day,\n",
      "and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I heard this morning\n",
      "may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at\n",
      "first.\"\n",
      "\"What did you hear?\"\n",
      "\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,\n",
      "whom I _knew_ to be engaged--but how shall I tell you? If you know it\n",
      "already, as surely you must, I may be spared.\"\n",
      "\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness, \"Mr. Willoughby's\n",
      "marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we _do_ know it all. This seems to have\n",
      "been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first\n",
      "unfolded it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies\n",
      "were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other\n",
      "an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\n",
      "concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name\n",
      "of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\n",
      "attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\n",
      "was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was\n",
      "no longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\n",
      "with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,\n",
      "especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\n",
      "more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe\n",
      "Magna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!--but it would be\n",
      "impossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt,\n",
      "on inquiry,--for I stayed in the shop till they were gone,--was a Mrs.\n",
      "Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss\n",
      "Grey's guardian.\"\n",
      "\"It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand\n",
      "pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.\"\n",
      "\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think--\" He\n",
      "stopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust\n",
      "itself, \"And your sister,--how did she,--\"\n",
      "\"Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they\n",
      "may be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel\n",
      "affliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;\n",
      "and even now, perhaps--but _I_ am almost convinced that he never was\n",
      "really attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some\n",
      "points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed! But your sister does\n",
      "not--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?\"\n",
      "\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still\n",
      "justify him if she could.\"\n",
      "He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the\n",
      "tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was\n",
      "necessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure\n",
      "while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss\n",
      "Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of\n",
      "hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening\n",
      "more serious and thoughtful than usual.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXI\n",
      "From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the\n",
      "next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had\n",
      "closed her eyes.\n",
      "Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt;\n",
      "and before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject\n",
      "again and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate\n",
      "counsel on Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying\n",
      "opinions on Marianne's, as before. Sometimes she could believe\n",
      "Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at\n",
      "others, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.\n",
      "At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all\n",
      "the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and\n",
      "at a third could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she\n",
      "was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was\n",
      "possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence\n",
      "when obliged to endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief\n",
      "of Mrs. Jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\n",
      "\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried; \"she cannot feel. Her kindness\n",
      "is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants\n",
      "is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\n",
      "Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her\n",
      "sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable\n",
      "refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her\n",
      "on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a\n",
      "polished manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half\n",
      "there be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities\n",
      "and an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She\n",
      "expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own,\n",
      "and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their\n",
      "actions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters\n",
      "were together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart\n",
      "of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her\n",
      "own weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\n",
      "though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost\n",
      "good-will.\n",
      "With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,\n",
      "from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room,\n",
      "saying--\n",
      "\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.\"\n",
      "Marianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her\n",
      "a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,\n",
      "explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and\n",
      "instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the\n",
      "room to enforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the\n",
      "assurances of his letter. The work of one moment was destroyed by the\n",
      "next. The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was\n",
      "before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed\n",
      "such an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant,\n",
      "she had never suffered.\n",
      "The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings, no language, within her reach in her\n",
      "moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could\n",
      "reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\n",
      "passionate violence;--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its\n",
      "object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still\n",
      "referring her to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she was\n",
      "calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled\n",
      "every page. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and\n",
      "relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by\n",
      "Elinor's application, to entreat from Marianne greater openness\n",
      "towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such\n",
      "affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future\n",
      "happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was\n",
      "dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her\n",
      "mistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be\n",
      "gone. Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for\n",
      "Marianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\n",
      "except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at\n",
      "length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy\n",
      "till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as\n",
      "herself; and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out\n",
      "alone for the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart,\n",
      "aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by\n",
      "Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation\n",
      "for it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had\n",
      "passed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who\n",
      "came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained\n",
      "fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her\n",
      "pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving\n",
      "still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\n",
      "In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when\n",
      "Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was\n",
      "startled by a rap at the door.\n",
      "\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor. \"So early too! I thought we _had_\n",
      "been safe.\"\n",
      "Marianne moved to the window--\n",
      "\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation. \"We are never safe\n",
      "from _him._\"\n",
      "\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"\n",
      "\"I will not trust to _that_,\" retreating to her own room. \"A man who\n",
      "has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion\n",
      "on that of others.\"\n",
      "The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on\n",
      "injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon _did_ come in; and Elinor,\n",
      "who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither,\n",
      "and who saw _that_ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\n",
      "and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive\n",
      "her sister for esteeming him so lightly.\n",
      "\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he, after the first\n",
      "salutation, \"and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more\n",
      "easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you\n",
      "alone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object--my wish--my sole\n",
      "wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of\n",
      "giving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but\n",
      "conviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind. My regard for\n",
      "her, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by\n",
      "relating some circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere\n",
      "regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am\n",
      "justified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing\n",
      "myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be\n",
      "wrong?\" He stopped.\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" said Elinor. \"You have something to tell me of Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will\n",
      "be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. _My_\n",
      "gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to\n",
      "that end, and _hers_ must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me\n",
      "hear it.\"\n",
      "\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but\n",
      "this will give you no idea--I must go farther back. You will find me a\n",
      "very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A\n",
      "short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it _shall_\n",
      "be a short one. On such a subject,\" sighing heavily, \"can I have\n",
      "little temptation to be diffuse.\"\n",
      "He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be\n",
      "supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation\n",
      "between us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a\n",
      "dance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling,\n",
      "in some measure, your sister Marianne.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have _not_ forgotten it.\" He looked\n",
      "pleased by this remembrance, and added--\n",
      "\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender\n",
      "recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well\n",
      "in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\n",
      "fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an\n",
      "orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our\n",
      "ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were\n",
      "playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not\n",
      "love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as\n",
      "perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you\n",
      "might think me incapable of having ever felt. Her's, for me, was, I\n",
      "believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At\n",
      "seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married--married\n",
      "against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our\n",
      "family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be\n",
      "said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\n",
      "My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped\n",
      "that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for\n",
      "some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she\n",
      "experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\n",
      "she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate! I have\n",
      "never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of\n",
      "eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my\n",
      "cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation\n",
      "far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\n",
      "till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too\n",
      "far, and the blow was a severe one, but had her marriage been happy,\n",
      "so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it,\n",
      "or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not\n",
      "the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not\n",
      "what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her\n",
      "unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so\n",
      "inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned\n",
      "herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it\n",
      "been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the\n",
      "remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a\n",
      "husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or\n",
      "restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their\n",
      "marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should\n",
      "fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the\n",
      "happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose\n",
      "had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\n",
      "he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of trifling\n",
      "weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years\n",
      "afterwards, of her divorce. It was _that_ which threw this\n",
      "gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered--\"\n",
      "He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes\n",
      "about the room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by\n",
      "his distress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her,\n",
      "took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few\n",
      "minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\n",
      "\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned\n",
      "to England. My first care, when I _did_ arrive, was of course to seek\n",
      "for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could\n",
      "not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\n",
      "fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\n",
      "sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\n",
      "sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\n",
      "brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\n",
      "before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\n",
      "that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\n",
      "dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I\n",
      "had been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former\n",
      "servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me\n",
      "to visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and\n",
      "there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my\n",
      "unfortunate sister. So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering\n",
      "of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure\n",
      "before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\n",
      "on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her--but I\n",
      "have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I\n",
      "have pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in\n",
      "the last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\n",
      "my greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time\n",
      "for a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her\n",
      "placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited\n",
      "her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\n",
      "last moments.\"\n",
      "Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in\n",
      "an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he, \"by the\n",
      "resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.\n",
      "Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural\n",
      "sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a\n",
      "happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see\n",
      "the other be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been\n",
      "distressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as\n",
      "this--untouched for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at\n",
      "all! I _will_ be more collected--more concise. She left to my care her\n",
      "only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty\n",
      "connection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child,\n",
      "and had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to\n",
      "me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by\n",
      "watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations\n",
      "allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was\n",
      "therefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and\n",
      "after the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago,\n",
      "and which left to me the possession of the family property,) she\n",
      "visited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am\n",
      "well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer\n",
      "connection with her. It is now three years ago (she had just reached\n",
      "her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her\n",
      "under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\n",
      "who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time\n",
      "of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her\n",
      "situation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly\n",
      "disappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\n",
      "out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young\n",
      "friends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him\n",
      "to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his\n",
      "daughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and\n",
      "ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though\n",
      "she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a\n",
      "quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for\n",
      "he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were\n",
      "ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he\n",
      "tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of\n",
      "his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I\n",
      "could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight\n",
      "long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I feared,\n",
      "may be imagined; and what I suffered too.\"\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could Willoughby!\"--\n",
      "\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued, \"came in a\n",
      "letter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from\n",
      "Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party\n",
      "to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\n",
      "which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,\n",
      "and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\n",
      "breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one\n",
      "whom he had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would\n",
      "it have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the\n",
      "smiles of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who\n",
      "_can_ feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and\n",
      "innocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with\n",
      "no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He\n",
      "had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\n",
      "relieved her.\"\n",
      "\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.\n",
      "\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse\n",
      "than both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess\n",
      "what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever,\n",
      "and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have\n",
      "felt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you\n",
      "alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to\n",
      "do when it _was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you\n",
      "then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so\n",
      "deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do? I had no hope of\n",
      "interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister's\n",
      "influence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable\n",
      "usage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may\n",
      "have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless _will_, turn\n",
      "with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with\n",
      "that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless\n",
      "situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an\n",
      "affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a\n",
      "mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\n",
      "Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her\n",
      "own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can\n",
      "bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still\n",
      "more her friend by them. Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for\n",
      "her fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own\n",
      "discretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You\n",
      "must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and\n",
      "from my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her\n",
      "regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this\n",
      "account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to\n",
      "have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"\n",
      "Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;\n",
      "attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage\n",
      "to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.\n",
      "\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her endeavors to acquit him\n",
      "than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most\n",
      "perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first\n",
      "she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have\n",
      "you,\" she continued, after a short silence, \"ever seen Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "since you left him at Barton?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have. One meeting was unavoidable.\"\n",
      "Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying--\n",
      "\"What? have you met him to--\"\n",
      "\"I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most\n",
      "reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town,\n",
      "which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he\n",
      "to defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the\n",
      "meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"\n",
      "Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a\n",
      "soldier she presumed not to censure it.\n",
      "\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, \"has been the unhappy\n",
      "resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so\n",
      "imperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"\n",
      "\"Is she still in town?\"\n",
      "\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near\n",
      "her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there\n",
      "she remains.\"\n",
      "Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor\n",
      "from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again\n",
      "the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion\n",
      "and esteem for him.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXII\n",
      "When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss\n",
      "Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was\n",
      "not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne\n",
      "appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to\n",
      "it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\n",
      "objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and\n",
      "seemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But\n",
      "though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt\n",
      "_was_ carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the\n",
      "effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he\n",
      "called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind\n",
      "of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less\n",
      "violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.\n",
      "Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\n",
      "She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she\n",
      "had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss\n",
      "Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his\n",
      "designs might _once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much\n",
      "on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she\n",
      "felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave\n",
      "more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most\n",
      "open and most frequent confession of them.\n",
      "To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and\n",
      "answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what\n",
      "her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly\n",
      "less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than\n",
      "Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\n",
      "arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her\n",
      "anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with\n",
      "fortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of\n",
      "Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!\n",
      "mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which\n",
      "_she_ could wish her not to indulge!\n",
      "Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had\n",
      "determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at\n",
      "that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be\n",
      "bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by\n",
      "constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen\n",
      "him there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all\n",
      "means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of\n",
      "which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to\n",
      "comprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of\n",
      "objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would\n",
      "be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at\n",
      "times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some\n",
      "amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.\n",
      "From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her\n",
      "to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his\n",
      "acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her\n",
      "friends. Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligence\n",
      "could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in\n",
      "its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of\n",
      "Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at\n",
      "Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\n",
      "first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain\n",
      "one.\n",
      "She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where\n",
      "they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his\n",
      "wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged\n",
      "it right that they should sometimes see their brother.\n",
      "Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she\n",
      "submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved\n",
      "perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt\n",
      "it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by\n",
      "requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\n",
      "possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her\n",
      "mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent\n",
      "her ever knowing a moment's rest.\n",
      "But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought\n",
      "evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the\n",
      "other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid\n",
      "Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their\n",
      "longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it\n",
      "would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.\n",
      "Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's\n",
      "name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing\n",
      "it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor\n",
      "Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\n",
      "Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards\n",
      "herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day\n",
      "after day to the indignation of them all.\n",
      "Sir John, could not have thought it possible. \"A man of whom he had\n",
      "always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He\n",
      "did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an\n",
      "unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.\n",
      "He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for\n",
      "all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,\n",
      "and they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel\n",
      "of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met\n",
      "that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this was the end\n",
      "of it!\"\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. \"She was determined to\n",
      "drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she\n",
      "had never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her\n",
      "heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,\n",
      "for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much\n",
      "that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should\n",
      "tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.\"\n",
      "The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shown in procuring all the\n",
      "particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and\n",
      "communicating them to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker's\n",
      "the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's\n",
      "portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be\n",
      "seen.\n",
      "The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a\n",
      "happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by\n",
      "the clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to\n",
      "be sure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their\n",
      "circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who\n",
      "would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any\n",
      "anxiety for her sister's health.\n",
      "Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the\n",
      "moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried\n",
      "down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more\n",
      "indispensable to comfort than good-nature.\n",
      "Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,\n",
      "or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, \"It is very\n",
      "shocking, indeed!\" and by the means of this continual though gentle\n",
      "vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first\n",
      "without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without\n",
      "recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the\n",
      "dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was\n",
      "wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the\n",
      "interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though\n",
      "rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would\n",
      "at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her\n",
      "as soon as she married.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome\n",
      "to Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate\n",
      "discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\n",
      "which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with\n",
      "confidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing\n",
      "past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye\n",
      "with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her\n",
      "voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or\n",
      "could oblige herself to speak to him. _These_ assured him that his\n",
      "exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and\n",
      "_these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;\n",
      "but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that\n",
      "the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither\n",
      "prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make\n",
      "it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of\n",
      "Mid-summer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end\n",
      "of a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding\n",
      "between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that\n",
      "the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would\n",
      "all be made over to _her_; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased\n",
      "to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.\n",
      "Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's\n",
      "letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he\n",
      "was married. She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to\n",
      "herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she\n",
      "was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it\n",
      "from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every\n",
      "morning.\n",
      "She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on\n",
      "it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would\n",
      "burst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less\n",
      "pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.\n",
      "The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now\n",
      "hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to\n",
      "prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow\n",
      "first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.\n",
      "About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's\n",
      "house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, presented themselves again\n",
      "before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and\n",
      "were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\n",
      "Elinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her\n",
      "pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the\n",
      "overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her _still_ in town.\n",
      "\"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here\n",
      "_still_,\" said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.\n",
      "\"But I always thought I _should_ I was almost sure you would not leave\n",
      "London yet awhile; though you _told_ me, you know, at Barton, that you\n",
      "should not stay above a _month._ But I thought, at the time, that you\n",
      "would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would\n",
      "have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and\n",
      "sister came. And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone.\n",
      "I am amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word._\"\n",
      "Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her\n",
      "self-command to make it appear that she did _not._\n",
      "\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did you travel?\"\n",
      "\"Not in the stage, I assure you,\" replied Miss Steele, with quick\n",
      "exultation; \"we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to\n",
      "attend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd join\n",
      "him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or\n",
      "twelve shillings more than we did.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, oh!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is\n",
      "a single man, I warrant you.\"\n",
      "\"There now,\" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, \"everybody laughs\n",
      "at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they\n",
      "are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never\n",
      "think about him from one hour's end to another. 'Lord! here comes your\n",
      "beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when she saw him crossing\n",
      "the street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who\n",
      "you mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine.\"\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won't do--the Doctor is\n",
      "the man, I see.\"\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, \"and I\n",
      "beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she\n",
      "certainly would _not_, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.\n",
      "\"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss\n",
      "Dashwood, when they come to town,\" said Lucy, returning, after a\n",
      "cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.\n",
      "\"No, I do not think we shall.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I dare say you will.\"\n",
      "Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\n",
      "\"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for\n",
      "so long a time together!\"\n",
      "\"Long a time, indeed!\" interposed Mrs. Jennings. \"Why, their visit is\n",
      "but just begun!\"\n",
      "Lucy was silenced.\n",
      "\"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\" said Miss\n",
      "Steele. \"I am sorry she is not well--\" for Marianne had left the room\n",
      "on their arrival.\n",
      "\"You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with\n",
      "nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and\n",
      "me!--I think she might see _us_; and I am sure we would not speak a\n",
      "word.\"\n",
      "Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was\n",
      "perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore\n",
      "not able to come to them.\n",
      "\"Oh, if that's all,\" cried Miss Steele, \"we can just as well go and\n",
      "see _her._\"\n",
      "Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but\n",
      "she was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand,\n",
      "which now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness\n",
      "to the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of\n",
      "the other.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXIII\n",
      "After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties,\n",
      "and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for\n",
      "half an hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no\n",
      "visits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in\n",
      "Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the\n",
      "exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\n",
      "When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there\n",
      "was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call;\n",
      "and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her\n",
      "young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return\n",
      "for them.\n",
      "On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people\n",
      "before them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to\n",
      "tend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be\n",
      "done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to\n",
      "promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing\n",
      "there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting\n",
      "his politeness to a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye,\n",
      "and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He\n",
      "was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size,\n",
      "shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining\n",
      "and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the\n",
      "shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no\n",
      "leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was\n",
      "comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which\n",
      "served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of\n",
      "strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first\n",
      "style of fashion.\n",
      "Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and\n",
      "resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on\n",
      "the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of\n",
      "the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by\n",
      "remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\n",
      "her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing\n",
      "around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.\n",
      "At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,\n",
      "all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the\n",
      "last day on which his existence could be continued without the\n",
      "possession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely\n",
      "care, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a\n",
      "one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off\n",
      "with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.\n",
      "Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point\n",
      "of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her\n",
      "side. She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some\n",
      "surprise to be her brother.\n",
      "Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very\n",
      "creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop. John Dashwood was really far\n",
      "from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them\n",
      "satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and\n",
      "attentive.\n",
      "Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.\n",
      "\"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\" said he, \"but it was\n",
      "impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts\n",
      "at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars. Harry was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended\n",
      "to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one\n",
      "has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to\n",
      "bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able\n",
      "to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the\n",
      "Middletons too, you must introduce me to _them_. As my mother-in-law's\n",
      "relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are\n",
      "excellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand.\"\n",
      "\"Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness\n",
      "in every particular, is more than I can express.\"\n",
      "\"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.\n",
      "But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are\n",
      "related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to\n",
      "make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you\n",
      "are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for\n",
      "nothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the\n",
      "most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all\n",
      "seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us\n",
      "to hear it, I assure you.\"\n",
      "Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to\n",
      "be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for\n",
      "them at the door.\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being\n",
      "able to call on them the next day, took leave.\n",
      "His visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from\n",
      "their sister-in-law, for not coming too; \"but she was so much engaged\n",
      "with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not\n",
      "stand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like\n",
      "it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and\n",
      "bring her sisters to see her. His manners to _them_, though calm, were\n",
      "perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a\n",
      "curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be\n",
      "rich, to be equally civil to _him._\n",
      "After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him\n",
      "to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.\n",
      "The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. As soon as\n",
      "they were out of the house, his enquiries began.\n",
      "\"Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.\"\n",
      "\"I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,\n",
      "Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable\n",
      "establishment in life.\"\n",
      "\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What\n",
      "is the amount of his fortune?\"\n",
      "\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\n",
      "\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself up to a pitch of\n",
      "enthusiastic generosity, he added, \"Elinor, I wish with all my heart\n",
      "it were _twice_ as much, for your sake.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am very sure that\n",
      "Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me._\n",
      "\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little\n",
      "trouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be\n",
      "undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his\n",
      "friends may all advise him against it. But some of those little\n",
      "attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\n",
      "him, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should\n",
      "not try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on\n",
      "your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is\n",
      "quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have\n",
      "too much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man;\n",
      "and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with\n",
      "you and your family. It is a match that must give universal\n",
      "satisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that,\" lowering his\n",
      "voice to an important whisper, \"will be exceedingly welcome to _all\n",
      "parties._\" Recollecting himself, however, he added, \"That is, I mean\n",
      "to say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled;\n",
      "Fanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I\n",
      "assure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured\n",
      "woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\n",
      "the other day.\"\n",
      "Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\n",
      "\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued, \"something\n",
      "droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the\n",
      "same time. And yet it is not very unlikely.\"\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution, \"going to be\n",
      "married?\"\n",
      "\"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.\n",
      "He has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost\n",
      "liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if\n",
      "the match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\n",
      "of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable\n",
      "connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place\n",
      "in time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away,\n",
      "to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give\n",
      "you another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we\n",
      "came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just\n",
      "now, she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two\n",
      "hundred pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a\n",
      "great expense while we are here.\"\n",
      "He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to\n",
      "say--\n",
      "\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be\n",
      "considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\n",
      "\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to\n",
      "complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope\n",
      "will in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying\n",
      "on, is a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase\n",
      "within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place,\n",
      "where old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me\n",
      "in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I\n",
      "felt it my duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my\n",
      "conscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his\n",
      "convenience; and it _has_ cost me a vast deal of money.\"\n",
      "\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\n",
      "\"Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for\n",
      "more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\n",
      "been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\n",
      "that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's\n",
      "hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.\"\n",
      "Elinor could only smile.\n",
      "\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming\n",
      "to Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the\n",
      "Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they\n",
      "were) to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he\n",
      "had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose,\n",
      "but, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large\n",
      "purchases of linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken\n",
      "away. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be\n",
      "from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality, I hope you\n",
      "may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\n",
      "\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\" he gravely replied; \"but\n",
      "however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone\n",
      "laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of the\n",
      "flower-garden marked out.\"\n",
      "\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\n",
      "\"Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come\n",
      "down to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many\n",
      "parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before\n",
      "it, and be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns\n",
      "that grew in patches over the brow.\"\n",
      "Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very\n",
      "thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.\n",
      "Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the\n",
      "necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in\n",
      "his next visit at Gray's, his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he\n",
      "began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of\n",
      "living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an\n",
      "acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but\n",
      "in the end may prove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town\n",
      "is certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks\n",
      "altogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she\n",
      "dies you will not be forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave.\"\n",
      "\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her\n",
      "jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\n",
      "\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few\n",
      "people of common prudence will do _that_; and whatever she saves, she\n",
      "will be able to dispose of.\"\n",
      "\"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her\n",
      "daughters, than to us?\"\n",
      "\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I\n",
      "cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.\n",
      "Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and\n",
      "treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on\n",
      "her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not\n",
      "disregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can\n",
      "hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.\"\n",
      "\"But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your\n",
      "anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.\"\n",
      "\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself, \"people have\n",
      "little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is\n",
      "the matter with Marianne?--she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,\n",
      "and is grown quite thin. Is she ill?\"\n",
      "\"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several\n",
      "weeks.\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness\n",
      "destroys the bloom for ever! Her's has been a very short one! She was\n",
      "as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to\n",
      "attract the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to\n",
      "please them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would\n",
      "marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly\n",
      "fond of _you_, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken,\n",
      "however. I question whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth\n",
      "more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very\n",
      "much deceived if _you_ do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very\n",
      "little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly\n",
      "glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having\n",
      "Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your\n",
      "visitors.\"\n",
      "Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no\n",
      "likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation\n",
      "of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really\n",
      "resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the\n",
      "marriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough\n",
      "for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly\n",
      "anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\n",
      "of atoning for his own neglect.\n",
      "They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John\n",
      "came in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on\n",
      "all sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood\n",
      "did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very\n",
      "good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his\n",
      "appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood\n",
      "went away delighted with both.\n",
      "\"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,\" said he, as he\n",
      "walked back with his sister. \"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant\n",
      "woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant\n",
      "as her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of\n",
      "visiting _her_, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case,\n",
      "and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow\n",
      "of a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her\n",
      "daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate\n",
      "with. But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXIV\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment,\n",
      "that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her\n",
      "daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\n",
      "even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means\n",
      "unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of\n",
      "the most charming women in the world!\n",
      "Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a\n",
      "kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually\n",
      "attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid\n",
      "propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.\n",
      "The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the\n",
      "good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little\n",
      "proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's\n",
      "sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to\n",
      "say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley\n",
      "Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\n",
      "Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not choose to ask,\n",
      "whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny\n",
      "voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that\n",
      "his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's\n",
      "expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed\n",
      "them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be\n",
      "too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The\n",
      "intelligence however, which _she_ would not give, soon flowed from\n",
      "another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion\n",
      "on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear\n",
      "of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to\n",
      "be told, they could do nothing at present but write.\n",
      "Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short\n",
      "time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on\n",
      "the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements. Elinor\n",
      "was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\n",
      "missed him.\n",
      "The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons,\n",
      "that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined\n",
      "to give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\n",
      "invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very\n",
      "good house for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were\n",
      "invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel\n",
      "Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were,\n",
      "received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more\n",
      "pleasure. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\n",
      "whether her sons were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing\n",
      "_her_, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement;\n",
      "for though she could now meet Edward's mother without that strong\n",
      "anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though\n",
      "she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of\n",
      "herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her\n",
      "curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\n",
      "The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon\n",
      "afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing\n",
      "that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.\n",
      "So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so\n",
      "agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was\n",
      "certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as\n",
      "ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit\n",
      "Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\n",
      "Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their\n",
      "visit should begin a few days before the party took place.\n",
      "Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of\n",
      "the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother,\n",
      "might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her\n",
      "table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\n",
      "who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a\n",
      "nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have\n",
      "an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier\n",
      "in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.\n",
      "On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to\n",
      "determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his\n",
      "mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the\n",
      "first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\n",
      "knew how she could bear it!\n",
      "These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and\n",
      "certainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her\n",
      "own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself\n",
      "to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward\n",
      "certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to\n",
      "be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept\n",
      "away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal\n",
      "when they were together.\n",
      "The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies\n",
      "to this formidable mother-in-law.\n",
      "\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs\n",
      "together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "that they all followed the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody\n",
      "here but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good\n",
      "gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness\n",
      "depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\n",
      "Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the\n",
      "possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own,\n",
      "whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured\n",
      "her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\n",
      "amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at\n",
      "least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in\n",
      "her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her\n",
      "complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and\n",
      "naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had\n",
      "rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it\n",
      "the strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of\n",
      "many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to\n",
      "the number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\n",
      "not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the\n",
      "spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\n",
      "Elinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months\n",
      "ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars' power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her\n",
      "manners to the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made\n",
      "to humble her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see\n",
      "the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very\n",
      "person--for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\n",
      "had they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious\n",
      "to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound\n",
      "them, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a\n",
      "graciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited\n",
      "folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with\n",
      "which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly\n",
      "despising them all four.\n",
      "Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss\n",
      "Steele wanted only to be teased about Dr. Davies to be perfectly\n",
      "happy.\n",
      "The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every\n",
      "thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's\n",
      "ability to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions\n",
      "which were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\n",
      "having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell\n",
      "out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had\n",
      "tried to infer from it; no poverty of any kind, except of\n",
      "conversation, appeared; but there, the deficiency was considerable.\n",
      "John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\n",
      "and his wife had still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in\n",
      "this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors,\n",
      "who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications\n",
      "for being agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\n",
      "of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\n",
      "When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this\n",
      "poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the\n",
      "discourse with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\n",
      "and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only\n",
      "engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative\n",
      "heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William,\n",
      "who were nearly of the same age.\n",
      "Had both the children been there, the affair might have been\n",
      "determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was\n",
      "present, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every\n",
      "body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to\n",
      "repeat it over and over again as often as they liked.\n",
      "The parties stood thus:--\n",
      "The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the\n",
      "tallest, politely decided in favour of the other. The two\n",
      "grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were\n",
      "equally earnest in support of their own descendant.\n",
      "Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,\n",
      "thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could\n",
      "not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world\n",
      "between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as\n",
      "fast as she could, in favour of each.\n",
      "Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by which\n",
      "she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the\n",
      "necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when\n",
      "called on for her's, offended them all, by declaring that she had no\n",
      "opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\n",
      "Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty\n",
      "pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted\n",
      "and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these\n",
      "screens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other\n",
      "gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel\n",
      "Brandon for his admiration.\n",
      "\"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you, as a man of\n",
      "taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether\n",
      "you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she\n",
      "is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.\"\n",
      "The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,\n",
      "warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by\n",
      "Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course\n",
      "excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look\n",
      "at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady\n",
      "Middleton's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,\n",
      "considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by\n",
      "Miss Dashwood.\n",
      "\"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without regarding them\n",
      "at all, returned them to her daughter.\n",
      "Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude\n",
      "enough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said--\n",
      "\"They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?\" But then again, the dread of\n",
      "having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over\n",
      "her, for she presently added, \"Do you not think they are something in\n",
      "Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She _does_ paint most\n",
      "delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\n",
      "\"Beautifully indeed! But _she_ does every thing well.\"\n",
      "Marianne could not bear this. She was already greatly displeased with\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's\n",
      "expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant\n",
      "by it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth--\n",
      "\"This is admiration of a very particular kind! what is Miss Morton to\n",
      "us? who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom _we_ think\n",
      "and speak.\"\n",
      "And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands,\n",
      "to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more\n",
      "stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \"Miss\n",
      "Morton is Lord Morton's daughter.\"\n",
      "Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at\n",
      "his sister's audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth\n",
      "than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as\n",
      "they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was\n",
      "amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a\n",
      "sister slighted in the smallest point.\n",
      "Marianne's feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell\n",
      "such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart\n",
      "taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\n",
      "affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's\n",
      "chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to\n",
      "hers, said in a low, but eager, voice--\n",
      "\"Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them. Don't let them make _you_\n",
      "unhappy.\"\n",
      "She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her\n",
      "face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body's\n",
      "attention was called, and almost every body was concerned. Colonel\n",
      "Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did. Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\n",
      "her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the\n",
      "author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to\n",
      "one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account\n",
      "of the whole shocking affair.\n",
      "In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end\n",
      "to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits\n",
      "retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.\n",
      "\"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,\n",
      "as soon as he could secure his attention: \"She has not such good\n",
      "health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's\n",
      "constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying\n",
      "to a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal\n",
      "attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_\n",
      "remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now\n",
      "you see it is all gone.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXV\n",
      "Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in\n",
      "her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between\n",
      "the families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her\n",
      "meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend\n",
      "all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and\n",
      "retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise\n",
      "free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_\n",
      "sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any\n",
      "other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence\n",
      "upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least,\n",
      "if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being\n",
      "fettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she\n",
      "_ought_ to have rejoiced.\n",
      "She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the\n",
      "civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so\n",
      "very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid\n",
      "her because she was _not Elinor_ appear a compliment to herself--or to\n",
      "allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\n",
      "because her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not\n",
      "only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over\n",
      "again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady\n",
      "Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing\n",
      "Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\n",
      "The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon\n",
      "after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\n",
      "\"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, \"I\n",
      "come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering\n",
      "as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable\n",
      "as she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the\n",
      "very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her\n",
      "behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to\n",
      "me. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck\n",
      "with it?\"\n",
      "\"She was certainly very civil to you.\"\n",
      "\"Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--I saw a vast deal\n",
      "more. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,\n",
      "no hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and\n",
      "affability!\"\n",
      "Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to\n",
      "own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to\n",
      "go on.\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\" said she, \"nothing\n",
      "could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was\n",
      "not the case--\"\n",
      "\"I guessed you would say so,\" replied Lucy quickly--\"but there was no\n",
      "reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she\n",
      "did not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan't talk me out of\n",
      "my satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no\n",
      "difficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a\n",
      "charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,\n",
      "indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood was!\"\n",
      "To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.\n",
      "\"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don't speak;--sure you\n",
      "an't well.\"\n",
      "\"I never was in better health.\"\n",
      "\"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I\n",
      "should be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest\n",
      "comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done\n",
      "without your friendship.\"--\n",
      "Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.\n",
      "But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied--\n",
      "\"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to\n",
      "Edward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward!--But\n",
      "now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty\n",
      "often, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall\n",
      "be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half\n",
      "his time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "will visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good\n",
      "to say more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are\n",
      "such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I\n",
      "think of her, you cannot speak too high.\"\n",
      "But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she\n",
      "_should_ tell her sister. Lucy continued.\n",
      "\"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took\n",
      "a dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for\n",
      "instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice\n",
      "of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I\n",
      "mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should\n",
      "have gave it all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where\n",
      "she _does_ dislike, I know it is most violent.\"\n",
      "Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by\n",
      "the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars,\n",
      "and Edward's immediately walking in.\n",
      "It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that\n",
      "it was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to\n",
      "have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to\n",
      "advance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest\n",
      "form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had\n",
      "fallen on them. They were not only all three together, but were\n",
      "together without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered\n",
      "themselves first. It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward,\n",
      "and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could\n",
      "therefore only _look_ her tenderness, and after slightly addressing\n",
      "him, said no more.\n",
      "But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and\n",
      "her own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's\n",
      "recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost\n",
      "easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\n",
      "improved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the\n",
      "consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from\n",
      "saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much\n",
      "regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.\n",
      "She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as\n",
      "a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes\n",
      "of Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.\n",
      "Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage\n",
      "enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the\n",
      "ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his\n",
      "sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of\n",
      "Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.\n",
      "Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no\n",
      "contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;\n",
      "and almost every thing that _was_ said, proceeded from Elinor, who was\n",
      "obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health,\n",
      "their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\n",
      "but never did.\n",
      "Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself\n",
      "so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching\n",
      "Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\n",
      "and _that_ in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several\n",
      "minutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude,\n",
      "before she went to her sister. When that was once done, however, it\n",
      "was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy\n",
      "hurried her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing\n",
      "him was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and\n",
      "strongly spoken. She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a\n",
      "voice that expressed the affection of a sister.\n",
      "\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great happiness!--This\n",
      "would almost make amends for every thing!\"\n",
      "Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such\n",
      "witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all\n",
      "sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was\n",
      "looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and\n",
      "sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other\n",
      "should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence. Edward was the first\n",
      "to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express\n",
      "his fear of her not finding London agree with her.\n",
      "\"Oh, don't think of me!\" she replied with spirited earnestness, though\n",
      "her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, \"don't think of _my_\n",
      "health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.\"\n",
      "This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor\n",
      "to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no\n",
      "very benignant expression.\n",
      "\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might\n",
      "introduce another subject.\n",
      "\"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.\n",
      "The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and\n",
      "thank Heaven! you are what you always were!\"\n",
      "She paused--no one spoke.\n",
      "\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must employ Edward to take\n",
      "care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we\n",
      "shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to\n",
      "accept the charge.\"\n",
      "Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even\n",
      "himself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace\n",
      "it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\n",
      "and soon talked of something else.\n",
      "\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so\n",
      "wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which\n",
      "cannot be said now.\"\n",
      "And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her\n",

      "\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on\n",
      "her, \"you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have\n",
      "no mind to keep them, little as well as great.\"\n",
      "Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the\n",
      "sting; for she calmly replied--\n",
      "\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\n",
      "conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe\n",
      "he _has_ the most delicate conscience in the world; the most\n",
      "scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however\n",
      "it may make against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful\n",
      "of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of\n",
      "being selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will\n",
      "say it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must\n",
      "be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem,\n",
      "must submit to my open commendation.\"\n",
      "The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened\n",
      "to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her\n",
      "auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon\n",
      "got up to go away.\n",
      "\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward, this must not be.\"\n",
      "And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy\n",
      "could not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he\n",
      "would go; and Lucy, who would have outstayed him, had his visit lasted\n",
      "two hours, soon afterwards went away.\n",
      "\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne, on her leaving\n",
      "them. \"Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teasing to\n",
      "Edward!\"\n",
      "\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known\n",
      "to him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as\n",
      "well as ourselves.\"\n",
      "Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know, Elinor, that\n",
      "this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to\n",
      "have your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case,\n",
      "you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do\n",
      "it. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not\n",
      "really wanted.\"\n",
      "She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,\n",
      "for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give\n",
      "no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the\n",
      "consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was\n",
      "obliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edward\n",
      "would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing\n",
      "Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of\n",
      "the pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had\n",
      "every reason to expect.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXVI\n",
      "Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\n",
      "world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\n",
      "son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\n",
      "to all those intimate connections who knew it before.\n",
      "This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a\n",
      "temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\n",
      "like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished\n",
      "to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every\n",
      "morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in\n",
      "the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\n",
      "Middletons, spent the whole of every day, in Conduit Street. For their\n",
      "own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\n",
      "morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged\n",
      "against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\n",
      "to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\n",
      "fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\n",
      "They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\n",
      "by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\n",
      "_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to\n",
      "monopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's\n",
      "behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\n",
      "Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not\n",
      "believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she\n",
      "fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to\n",
      "be satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common\n",
      "use, and easily given.\n",
      "Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the\n",
      "idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was\n",
      "ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\n",
      "proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\n",
      "despise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\n",
      "three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her\n",
      "to it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and\n",
      "minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr.\n",
      "Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the\n",
      "sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\n",
      "arrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though\n",
      "she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and\n",
      "more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before\n",
      "Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the\n",
      "former, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might\n",
      "have made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about\n",
      "the Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined\n",
      "to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a\n",
      "whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what\n",
      "she was kind enough to bestow on herself.\n",
      "All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally\n",
      "unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing\n",
      "for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young\n",
      "friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old\n",
      "woman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at\n",
      "her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent\n",
      "spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well\n",
      "doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail\n",
      "of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\n",
      "One thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.\n",
      "Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his\n",
      "sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly\n",
      "perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between\n",
      "this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no\n",
      "convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was\n",
      "not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even\n",
      "be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the\n",
      "finest child in the world.\n",
      "I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time\n",
      "befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters\n",
      "with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\n",
      "of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not\n",
      "apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations\n",
      "of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\n",
      "conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness\n",
      "must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\n",
      "instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\n",
      "truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she\n",
      "immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\n",
      "misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\n",
      "invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a\n",
      "small musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly\n",
      "great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods,\n",
      "but, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness\n",
      "of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that\n",
      "they might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of\n",
      "disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's. But that was\n",
      "not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which\n",
      "they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any\n",
      "thing better from them.\n",
      "Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\n",
      "going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\n",
      "her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and\n",
      "mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting\n",
      "the smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till\n",
      "the last moment, where it was to take her.\n",
      "To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as\n",
      "not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her\n",
      "toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes\n",
      "of their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_\n",
      "minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and\n",
      "asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every\n",
      "part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns\n",
      "altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not\n",
      "without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing\n",
      "cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\n",
      "The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\n",
      "concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was\n",
      "considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after\n",
      "undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the\n",
      "colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost\n",
      "sure of being told that upon \"her word she looked vastly smart, and\n",
      "she dared to say she would make a great many conquests.\"\n",
      "With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present\n",
      "occasion, to her brother's carriage; which they were ready to enter\n",
      "five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very\n",
      "agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\n",
      "of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part\n",
      "that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.\n",
      "The events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like\n",
      "other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real\n",
      "taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;\n",
      "and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\n",
      "and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in\n",
      "England.\n",
      "As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no\n",
      "scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it\n",
      "suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and\n",
      "violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the\n",
      "room. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of\n",
      "young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on\n",
      "toothpick-cases at Gray's. She perceived him soon afterwards looking\n",
      "at herself, and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just\n",
      "determined to find out his name from the latter, when they both came\n",
      "towards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert\n",
      "Ferrars.\n",
      "He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow\n",
      "which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was\n",
      "exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy\n",
      "had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his\n",
      "own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his\n",
      "brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the\n",
      "ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she\n",
      "wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that\n",
      "the emptiness and conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with\n",
      "the modesty and worth of the other. Why they _were_ different, Robert\n",
      "explained to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's\n",
      "conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\n",
      "_gaucherie_ which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper\n",
      "society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any\n",
      "natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;\n",
      "while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material\n",
      "superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\n",
      "was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\n",
      "\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more; and so I\n",
      "often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. 'My dear Madam,'\n",
      "I always say to her, 'you must make yourself easy. The evil is now\n",
      "irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you\n",
      "be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to\n",
      "place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his\n",
      "life? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,\n",
      "instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been\n",
      "prevented.' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and\n",
      "my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\n",
      "Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her\n",
      "general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not\n",
      "think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.\n",
      "\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his next observation, \"in a\n",
      "cottage near Dawlish.\"\n",
      "Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather\n",
      "surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without\n",
      "living near Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on\n",
      "their species of house.\n",
      "\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond of a cottage; there\n",
      "is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,\n",
      "if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one\n",
      "myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself\n",
      "down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I\n",
      "advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend\n",
      "Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\n",
      "and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's. I was to decide\n",
      "on the best of them. 'My dear Courtland,' said I, immediately throwing\n",
      "them all into the fire, 'do not adopt either of them, but by all means\n",
      "build a cottage.' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\n",
      "\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in\n",
      "a cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend\n",
      "Elliott's, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. 'But\n",
      "how can it be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is\n",
      "to be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten\n",
      "couple, and where can the supper be?' I immediately saw that there\n",
      "could be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not\n",
      "be uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\n",
      "card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open\n",
      "for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the\n",
      "saloon.' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the\n",
      "dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the\n",
      "affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you\n",
      "see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be\n",
      "as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.\"\n",
      "Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the\n",
      "compliment of rational opposition.\n",
      "As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,\n",
      "his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a\n",
      "thought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his\n",
      "wife, for her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of\n",
      "Mrs. Dennison's mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had\n",
      "suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,\n",
      "while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her from home. The expense\n",
      "would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an\n",
      "attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be\n",
      "requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his\n",
      "father. Fanny was startled at the proposal.\n",
      "\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she, \"without affronting Lady\n",
      "Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be\n",
      "exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any\n",
      "attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But\n",
      "they are Lady Middleton's visitors. How can I ask them away from her?\"\n",
      "Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her\n",
      "objection. \"They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit\n",
      "Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the\n",
      "same number of days to such near relations.\"\n",
      "Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said--\n",
      "\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.\n",
      "But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend\n",
      "a few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls;\n",
      "and I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\n",
      "well by Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but\n",
      "the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like\n",
      "them; indeed, you _do_ like them, you know, very much already, and so\n",
      "does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!\"\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss\n",
      "Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution\n",
      "of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly\n",
      "suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by\n",
      "bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as\n",
      "_their_ visitor.\n",
      "Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had\n",
      "procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company\n",
      "and her sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady\n",
      "Middleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and\n",
      "reasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,\n",
      "herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such\n",
      "an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all\n",
      "things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the\n",
      "most gratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not\n",
      "be too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the\n",
      "visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,\n",
      "was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days'\n",
      "time.\n",
      "When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after\n",
      "its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the\n",
      "expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed\n",
      "on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will\n",
      "towards her arose from something more than merely malice against\n",
      "herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing\n",
      "that Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady\n",
      "Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of\n",
      "greater.\n",

      "accounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in\n",
      "her life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book\n",

      "Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother\n",
      "felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her;\n",
      "and, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day,\n",
      "returned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in\n",
      "which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former\n",
      "share.\n",
      "About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in\n",
      "Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit\n",
      "to Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by\n",
      "herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to\n",
      "hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,\n",
      "began directly to justify it, by saying--\n",
      "\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\n",
      "\"No, ma'am. What is it?\"\n",
      "\"Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.\n",
      "Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was\n",
      "sure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\n",
      "So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,' says I, 'it is\n",
      "nothing in the world, but the red gum--' and nurse said just the same.\n",
      "But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent\n",
      "for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\n",
      "stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said\n",
      "just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and\n",
      "then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it\n",
      "came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\n",
      "it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\n",
      "that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\n",
      "something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear any\n",
      "unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\n",
      "their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\n",
      "believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will\n",
      "do very well.'\"\n",
      "\"What! is Fanny ill?\"\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I said, my dear. 'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of\n",
      "the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,\n",
      "the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\n",
      "turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.\n",
      "Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to\n",
      "my cousin Lucy! There's for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\n",
      "syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\n",
      "thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\n",
      "but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\n",
      "suspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\n",
      "or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this\n",
      "was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor\n",
      "your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\n",
      "morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no\n",
      "conjurer, popt it all out. 'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are\n",
      "all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about\n",
      "it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone\n",
      "at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had\n",
      "just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she\n",
      "thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or\n",
      "other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her\n",
      "vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with\n",
      "such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his\n",
      "own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his\n",
      "steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene\n",
      "took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\n",
      "what was going on. Poor soul! I pity _her._ And I must say, I think\n",
      "she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and\n",
      "soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees,\n",
      "and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and\n",
      "said he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should\n",
      "not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to\n",
      "go down upon _his_ knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till\n",
      "they had packed up their clothes. _Then_ she fell into hysterics\n",
      "again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\n",
      "and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was\n",
      "at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just\n",
      "stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\n",
      "she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I\n",
      "have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it\n",
      "will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward\n",
      "will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully!\n",
      "for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not\n",
      "wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan\n",
      "thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and\n",
      "the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that\n",
      "he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was\n",
      "sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister\n",
      "was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I\n",
      "care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people's\n",
      "making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on\n",
      "earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has\n",
      "next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make\n",
      "the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow\n",
      "him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it\n",
      "as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in\n",
      "such another cottage as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and\n",
      "two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty\n",
      "has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.\"\n",
      "Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to\n",
      "collect her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make\n",
      "such observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to\n",
      "produce. Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\n",
      "interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped\n",
      "might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to\n",
      "Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she\n",
      "felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and\n",
      "to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the\n",
      "conduct of every one concerned in it.\n",
      "She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event\n",
      "really was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its\n",
      "being possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of\n",
      "Edward and Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there\n",
      "could not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still\n",
      "more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. For _him_ she\n",
      "felt much compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some\n",
      "pains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\n",
      "As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the\n",
      "necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be\n",
      "lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,\n",
      "and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\n",
      "without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any\n",
      "resentment against Edward.\n",
      "Elinor's office was a painful one. She was going to remove what she\n",
      "really believed to be her sister's chief consolation,--to give such\n",
      "particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her\n",
      "good opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their\n",
      "situations, which to _her_ fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\n",
      "disappointment over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it\n",
      "was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.\n",
      "She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to\n",
      "represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the\n",
      "self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward's\n",
      "engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\n",
      "Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given\n",
      "without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor\n",
      "impetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne\n",
      "listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the\n",
      "comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and\n",
      "all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure\n",
      "of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge\n",
      "but of imprudence, was readily offered.\n",
      "But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed\n",
      "a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she _had_\n",
      "loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for\n",
      "Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\n",
      "incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded\n",
      "at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of\n",
      "Edward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and\n",
      "Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only\n",
      "could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.\n",
      "Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact\n",
      "of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed. Marianne's\n",
      "feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of\n",
      "detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her\n",
      "distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. The first\n",
      "question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was--\n",
      "\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?\"\n",
      "\"I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton\n",
      "Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.\"\n",
      "At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her\n",
      "lips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--\n",
      "\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\n",
      "Elinor confirmed it.\n",
      "\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your\n",
      "heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!\"--\n",
      "\"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!\"\n",
      "\"Four months!\" cried Marianne again. \"So calm! so cheerful! how have\n",
      "you been supported?\"\n",
      "\"By feeling that I was doing my duty. My promise to Lucy, obliged me\n",
      "to be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of\n",
      "the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in\n",
      "them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to\n",
      "satisfy.\"\n",
      "Marianne seemed much struck.\n",
      "\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,\" added\n",
      "Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it; but without betraying\n",
      "my trust, I never could have convinced you.\"\n",
      "\"Four months! and yet you loved him!\"\n",
      "\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others\n",
      "was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.\n",
      "Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have\n",
      "you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer\n",
      "materially myself. I have many things to support me. I am not\n",
      "conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of\n",
      "my own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it\n",
      "farther. I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. I wish him very\n",
      "happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now\n",
      "he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. Lucy does\n",
      "not want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good\n",
      "may be built. And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in\n",
      "the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said\n",
      "of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is\n",
      "not meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.\n",
      "Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and\n",
      "understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to\n",
      "forget that he ever thought another superior to _her._\"\n",
      "\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne, \"if the loss of what\n",
      "is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your\n",
      "resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\n",
      "wondered at. They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\"I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For\n",
      "four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without\n",
      "being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it\n",
      "would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\n",
      "to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told\n",
      "me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose\n",
      "prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,\n",
      "with triumph. This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to\n",
      "oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\n",
      "deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her\n",
      "hopes and exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself\n",
      "to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance\n",
      "that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him\n",
      "unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had\n",
      "to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of\n",
      "his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without\n",
      "enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,\n",
      "when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If\n",
      "you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that\n",
      "I have suffered _now._ The composure of mind with which I have brought\n",
      "myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have\n",
      "been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful\n",
      "exertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to\n",
      "relieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. _Then_, if I had not been\n",
      "bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not\n",
      "even what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly showing that I was\n",
      "_very_ unhappy.\"--\n",
      "Marianne was quite subdued.\n",
      "\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate myself for ever. How\n",
      "barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who\n",
      "have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only\n",
      "suffering for me! Is this my gratitude? Is this the only return I can\n",
      "make you? Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying\n",
      "to do it away.\"\n",
      "The tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of\n",
      "mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her\n",
      "whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\n",
      "never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of\n",
      "bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of\n",
      "dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should\n",
      "bring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.\n",
      "These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had\n",
      "injured, no reparation could be too much for her to make.\n",
      "She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration. She\n",
      "attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with\n",
      "an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard\n",
      "three times to say, \"Yes, ma'am.\"--She listened to her praise of Lucy\n",
      "with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.\n",
      "Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to\n",
      "any thing herself.\n",
      "The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their\n",
      "brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful\n",
      "affair, and bring them news of his wife.\n",
      "\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity, as soon as\n",
      "he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery that took place under\n",
      "our roof yesterday.\"\n",
      "They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.\n",
      "\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but\n",
      "I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of\n",
      "us quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But\n",
      "I would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing\n",
      "materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her\n",
      "resolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the\n",
      "fortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody\n",
      "again; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting\n",
      "with such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much\n",
      "confidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her\n",
      "heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely\n",
      "because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\n",
      "well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we\n",
      "both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us,\n",
      "while your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to\n",
      "be so rewarded! 'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her\n",
      "affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.'\"\n",
      "Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.\n",
      "\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is\n",
      "not to be described. While she with the truest affection had been\n",
      "planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed\n",
      "that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another\n",
      "person!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she\n",
      "suspected _any_ prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_\n",
      "quarter. '_There_ to be sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself\n",
      "safe.' She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as\n",
      "to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.\n",
      "He came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "could say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as\n",
      "you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of\n",
      "no avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never\n",
      "thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained\n",
      "to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told\n",
      "him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of\n",
      "land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\n",
      "grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this,\n",
      "if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the\n",
      "certain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds\n",
      "she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so\n",
      "far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if\n",
      "he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support,\n",
      "she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.\"\n",
      "Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands\n",
      "together, and cried, \"Gracious God! can this be possible!\"\n",
      "\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother, \"at the\n",
      "obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation\n",
      "is very natural.\"\n",
      "Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and\n",
      "forbore.\n",
      "\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain. Edward said\n",
      "very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.\n",
      "Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would\n",
      "stand to it, cost him what it might.\"\n",
      "\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be\n",
      "silent, \"he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.\n",
      "Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a\n",
      "rascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as\n",
      "yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a\n",
      "better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good\n",
      "husband.\"\n",
      "John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not\n",
      "open to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially\n",
      "anybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any\n",
      "resentment--\n",
      "\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,\n",
      "madam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,\n",
      "but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.\n",
      "And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under\n",
      "her uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large\n",
      "fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little\n",
      "extraordinary. In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour\n",
      "of any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish\n",
      "her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole,\n",
      "has been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like\n",
      "circumstances, would adopt. It has been dignified and liberal. Edward\n",
      "has drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one.\"\n",
      "Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung\n",
      "for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a\n",
      "woman who could not reward him.\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--Edward is\n",
      "dismissed for ever from his mother's notice. He left her house\n",
      "yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do\n",
      "not know; for _we_ of course can make no inquiry.\"\n",
      "\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\n",
      "\"What, indeed, ma'am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the\n",
      "prospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more\n",
      "deplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on\n",
      "it?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but\n",
      "for his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two\n",
      "thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand\n",
      "pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must\n",
      "all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our\n",
      "power to assist him.\"\n",
      "\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure he should be very\n",
      "welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I\n",
      "could see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own\n",
      "charge now, at lodgings and taverns.\"\n",
      "Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though\n",
      "she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\n",
      "\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\" said John Dashwood,\n",
      "\"as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been\n",
      "in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it\n",
      "is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him. And there is one\n",
      "thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his\n",
      "mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle\n",
      "_that_ estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's,\n",
      "on proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer,\n",
      "talking over the business.\"\n",
      "\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is _her_ revenge. Everybody has a\n",
      "way of their own. But I don't think mine would be, to make one son\n",
      "independent, because another had plagued me.\"\n",
      "Marianne got up and walked about the room.\n",
      "\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\" continued John,\n",
      "\"than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which\n",
      "might have been his own? Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely.\"\n",
      "A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his\n",
      "visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really\n",
      "believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and\n",
      "that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\n",
      "leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present\n",
      "occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the\n",
      "Dashwoods', and Edward's.\n",
      "Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and\n",
      "as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the\n",
      "party.\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXVIII\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but\n",
      "only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. _They_ only knew\n",
      "how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small\n",
      "was the consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that\n",
      "could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried\n",
      "in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion\n",
      "for his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by this\n",
      "public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject\n",
      "on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor\n",
      "avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her\n",
      "thoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that\n",
      "belief of Edward's continued affection for herself which she rather\n",
      "wished to do away; and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying\n",
      "to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with\n",
      "herself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between\n",
      "Elinor's conduct and her own.\n",
      "She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had\n",
      "hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of\n",
      "continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never\n",
      "exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\n",
      "without the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that she\n",
      "still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only\n",
      "dispirited her more.\n",
      "Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs\n",
      "in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings. But though so much of the\n",
      "matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had\n",
      "enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking\n",
      "after more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\n",
      "and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the\n",
      "hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them\n",
      "within that time.\n",
      "The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so\n",
      "fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,\n",
      "though it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor\n",
      "were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were\n",
      "again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather\n",
      "to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.\n",
      "An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they\n",
      "entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing\n",
      "with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was\n",
      "herself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\n",
      "nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by\n",
      "any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last\n",
      "she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,\n",
      "though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting\n",
      "them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor--\n",
      "\"Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you\n",
      "ask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\n",
      "It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too,\n",
      "that she would tell any thing _without_ being asked; for nothing would\n",
      "otherwise have been learnt.\n",
      "\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by\n",
      "the arm--\"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.\" And\n",
      "then lowering her voice, \"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about\n",
      "it. Is she angry?\"\n",
      "\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\n",
      "\"That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is _she_ angry?\"\n",
      "\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\n",
      "\"I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of\n",
      "it! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she\n",
      "would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me\n",
      "again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are\n",
      "as good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put\n",
      "in the feather last night. There now, _you_ are going to laugh at me\n",
      "too. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it _is_\n",
      "the Doctor's favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never\n",
      "have known he _did_ like it better than any other colour, if he had\n",
      "not happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare\n",
      "sometimes I do not know which way to look before them.\"\n",
      "She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,\n",
      "and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to\n",
      "the first.\n",
      "\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly, \"people may say what\n",
      "they choose about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for\n",
      "it is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such\n",
      "ill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think\n",
      "about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set\n",
      "it down for certain.\"\n",
      "\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,\"\n",
      "said Elinor.\n",
      "\"Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\n",
      "than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\n",
      "could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\n",
      "thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\n",
      "nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides\n",
      "that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point\n",
      "he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come\n",
      "near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I\n",
      "believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away\n",
      "from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all\n",
      "Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of\n",
      "him. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose\n",
      "against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from\n",
      "church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday\n",
      "to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them,\n",
      "and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy,\n",
      "and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by\n",
      "what passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,\n",
      "he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or\n",
      "other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday,\n",
      "on purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and\n",
      "over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\n",
      "and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the\n",
      "engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but\n",
      "two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to\n",
      "go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a\n",
      "curacy, and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to\n",
      "think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least\n",
      "mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift\n",
      "for himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\n",
      "And it was entirely for _her_ sake, and upon _her_ account, that he\n",
      "said a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath\n",
      "he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to\n",
      "marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would\n",
      "not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a\n",
      "great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that--Oh, la! one\n",
      "can't repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly, she\n",
      "had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with\n",
      "him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be\n",
      "very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then\n",
      "he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should\n",
      "do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait\n",
      "to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any\n",
      "more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was\n",
      "come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so\n",
      "I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if\n",
      "she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just\n",
      "run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with\n",
      "the Richardsons.\"\n",
      "\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\" said Elinor;\n",
      "\"you were all in the same room together, were not you?\"\n",
      "\"No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love\n",
      "when any body else is by? Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know\n",
      "better than that. (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in\n",
      "the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at\n",
      "the door.\"\n",
      "\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me what you only\n",
      "learnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it\n",
      "before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me\n",
      "particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known\n",
      "yourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, la! there is nothing in _that._ I only stood at the door, and\n",
      "heard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same\n",
      "by me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many\n",
      "secrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or\n",
      "behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\n",
      "Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be\n",
      "kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.\n",
      "\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she; \"but now he is\n",
      "lodging at No. --, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is,\n",
      "an't she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I\n",
      "shan't say anything against them to _you_; and to be sure they did\n",
      "send us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.\n",
      "And for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask\n",
      "us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\n",
      "nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of\n",
      "sight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go\n",
      "there for a time; and after _that_, as soon as he can light upon a\n",
      "Bishop, he will be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good\n",
      "gracious! (giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what my\n",
      "cousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should\n",
      "write to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. I\n",
      "know they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the\n",
      "world. 'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think of\n",
      "such a thing? I write to the Doctor, indeed!'\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared against the\n",
      "worst. You have got your answer ready.\"\n",
      "Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach\n",
      "of her own party made another more necessary.\n",
      "\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to\n",
      "you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you\n",
      "they are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and\n",
      "they keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not\n",
      "in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything\n",
      "should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay\n",
      "with her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton\n",
      "won't ask us any more this bout. Good-bye; I am sorry Miss Marianne was\n",
      "not here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your\n",
      "spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.\"\n",
      "Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay\n",
      "her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was\n",
      "claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of\n",
      "knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though\n",
      "she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen\n",
      "and foreplanned in her own mind. Edward's marriage with Lucy was as\n",
      "firmly determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as\n",
      "absolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing\n",
      "depended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that\n",
      "preferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest\n",
      "chance.\n",
      "As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for\n",
      "information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible\n",
      "intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\n",
      "she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple\n",
      "particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own\n",
      "consequence, would choose to have known. The continuance of their\n",
      "engagement, and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its\n",
      "end, was all her communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "the following natural remark:--\n",
      "\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how _that_ will\n",
      "end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,\n",
      "will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest\n",
      "of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.\n",
      "Pratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord\n",
      "help 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them\n",
      "towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I\n",
      "talked of t'other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all\n",
      "works. Betty's sister would never do for them _now._\"\n",
      "The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from\n",
      "Lucy herself. It was as follows:\n",
      "\"Bartlett's Building, March.\n",
      "     \"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take\n",
      "     of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will\n",
      "     make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and\n",
      "     my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through\n",
      "     lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed\n",
      "     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered dreadfully,\n",
      "     we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always\n",
      "     be in one another's love. We have had great trials, and\n",
      "     great persecutions, but however, at the same time,\n",
      "     gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least\n",
      "     among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully\n",
      "     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it. I am\n",

      "     have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be\n",
      "     sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be\n",
      "     ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to\n",
      "     recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am\n",
      "     very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "     too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or\n",
      "     Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.\n",
      "     Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it\n",
      "     for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't\n",
      "     think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come\n",

      "praise.\n",
      "\"Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite\n",
      "proper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy. Poor\n",
      "soul! I wish I _could_ get him a living, with all my heart. She calls\n",
      "me dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever\n",
      "lived. Very well upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned.\n",
      "Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to\n",
      "think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for showing it me. It is as\n",
      "pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great\n",
      "credit.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER XXXIX\n",
      "The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,\n",
      "and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed\n",
      "for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that\n",
      "if any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly\n",
      "less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less\n",
      "bent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of\n",
      "the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be\n",
      "brought to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her\n",
      "thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their\n",
      "wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence\n",
      "of her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining\n",
      "them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether\n",
      "much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to\n",
      "Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from\n",
      "Charlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been\n",
      "sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was enforced\n",
      "with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the\n",
      "very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had\n",
      "been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.\n",
      "When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was\n",
      "not very auspicious.\n",
      "\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation. \"No, I cannot go to\n",
      "Cleveland.\"--\n",
      "\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation is not--that it\n",
      "is not in the neighbourhood of--\"\n",
      "\"But it is in Somersetshire. I cannot go into Somersetshire. There,\n",
      "where I looked forward to going;--no, Elinor, you cannot expect me to\n",
      "go there.\"\n",
      "Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such\n",
      "feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on\n",
      "others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the\n",
      "time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to\n",
      "see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan\n",
      "could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which\n",
      "was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not\n",
      "beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's\n",
      "servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there\n",
      "could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they\n",
      "might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time. As\n",
      "Marianne's affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with\n",
      "little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest, that she\n",
      "pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.\n",
      "Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her\n",
      "design; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every\n",
      "thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could\n",
      "be;--and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the\n",
      "hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.\n",
      "\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings's address to him when he first called\n",
      "on her, after their leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite\n",
      "resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall\n",
      "be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as\n",
      "dull as two cats.\"\n",
      "Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their\n",
      "future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give\n",
      "himself an escape from it; and if so, she had soon afterwards good\n",
      "reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the\n",
      "window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she\n",
      "was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of\n",
      "particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.\n",
      "The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her\n",
      "observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\n",
      "changed her seat, on purpose that she might _not_ hear, to one close\n",
      "by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep\n",
      "herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with\n",
      "agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her\n",
      "employment. Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the\n",
      "interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words\n",
      "of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be\n",
      "apologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a\n",
      "doubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;\n",
      "but supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply\n",
      "she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips,\n",
      "that she did not think _that_ any material objection;--and Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then\n",
      "talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable,\n",
      "when another lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these\n",
      "words in the Colonel's calm voice,--\n",
      "\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\n",
      "Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost\n",
      "ready to cry out, \"Lord! what should hinder it?\"--but checking her\n",
      "desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.\n",
      "\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\n",
      "This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or\n",
      "mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the\n",
      "conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her to\n",
      "feel what she said--\n",
      "\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that\n",
      "after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take\n",
      "leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and\n",
      "go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old\n",
      "friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\n",
      "What had really passed between them was to this effect.\n",
      "\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion, \"of the injustice your\n",
      "friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand\n",
      "the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for\n",
      "persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have\n",
      "I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"\n",
      "Elinor told him that it was.\n",
      "\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied, with great\n",
      "feeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people\n",
      "long attached to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know\n",
      "what she may be doing--what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with\n",
      "him. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted\n",
      "in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for\n",
      "his own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I\n",
      "understand that he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to\n",
      "tell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am\n",
      "informed by this day's post, is his, if he think it worth his\n",
      "acceptance--but _that_, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he\n",
      "is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were\n",
      "more valuable. It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I\n",
      "believe, did not make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is\n",
      "certainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to\n",
      "afford him a very comfortable income. Such as it is, however, my\n",
      "pleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great. Pray assure him\n",
      "of it.\"\n",
      "Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been\n",
      "greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.\n",
      "The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as\n",
      "hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--and\n",
      "_she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her\n",
      "emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different\n",
      "cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might\n",
      "have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\n",
      "and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together\n",
      "prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly\n",
      "expressed. She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of\n",
      "Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew\n",
      "them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with\n",
      "pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\n",
      "to another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no\n",
      "one could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short,\n",
      "from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an\n",
      "obligation from _her_, she would have been very glad to be spared\n",
      "herself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining\n",
      "it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her\n",
      "means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.\n",
      "Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard\n",
      "his address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to inform\n",
      "him of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled,\n",
      "Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so\n",
      "respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and _then_ it was that he\n",
      "mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent; an\n",
      "evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very\n",
      "light of, at least as far as regarded its size.\n",
      "\"The smallness of the house,\" said she, \"I cannot imagine any\n",
      "inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family\n",
      "and income.\"\n",
      "By which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering\n",
      "Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;\n",
      "for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply\n",
      "such an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to\n",
      "settle on, and he said so.\n",
      "\"This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry\n",
      "to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly\n",
      "more extensive. If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in\n",
      "my power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him\n",
      "from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I\n",
      "sincerely wish I could be at present. What I am now doing indeed,\n",
      "seems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what\n",
      "must be his principal, his only object of happiness. His marriage must\n",
      "still be a distant good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place\n",
      "very soon.\"\n",
      "Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended\n",
      "the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of\n",
      "what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they\n",
      "stood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their\n",
      "parting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,\n",
      "nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of\n",
      "marriage.\n",
      "CHAPTER XL\n",
      "\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as\n",
      "soon as the gentleman had withdrawn, \"I do not ask you what the\n",
      "Colonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I _tried_\n",
      "to keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand\n",
      "his business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,\n",
      "and I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Elinor. \"It is a matter of great joy to me;\n",
      "and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are\n",
      "not many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so\n",
      "compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.\"\n",
      "\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an't the least astonished at it\n",
      "in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more\n",
      "likely to happen.\"\n",
      "\"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence;\n",
      "but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very\n",
      "soon occur.\"\n",
      "\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that, when a man has\n",
      "once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon\n",
      "find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and\n",
      "again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I\n",
      "shall soon know where to look for them.\"\n",
      "\"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\" said Elinor, with a\n",
      "faint smile.\n",
      "\"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,\n",
      "I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as\n",
      "ever I saw.\"\n",
      "\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"\n",
      "\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he repair it? who should do\n",
      "it but himself?\"\n",
      "They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the\n",
      "carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to\n",
      "go, said--\n",
      "\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.\n",
      "But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be\n",
      "quite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind\n",
      "is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\n",
      "long to tell your sister all about it.\"\n",
      "Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.\n",
      "\"Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not\n",
      "mention it at present to any body else.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! very well,\" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. \"Then you\n",
      "would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as\n",
      "Holborn to-day.\"\n",
      "\"No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day's delay will not be\n",
      "very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it\n",
      "ought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do _that_\n",
      "directly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\n",
      "for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination.\"\n",
      "This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she\n",
      "could not immediately comprehend. A few moments' reflection, however,\n",
      "produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed--\n",
      "\"Oh, ho! I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much\n",
      "the better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;\n",
      "and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my\n",
      "dear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel\n",
      "write himself? Sure, he is the proper person.\"\n",
      "Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore\n",
      "only replied to its conclusion.\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one\n",
      "to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.\"\n",
      "\"And so _you_ are forced to do it. Well _that_ is an odd kind of\n",
      "delicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to\n",
      "write.) You know your own concerns best. So good-bye, my dear. I have\n",
      "not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was\n",
      "brought to bed.\"\n",
      "And away she went; but returning again in a moment--\n",
      "\"I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear. I should be\n",
      "very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for\n",
      "a lady's maid, I am sure I can't tell. She is an excellent housemaid,\n",
      "and works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that\n",
      "at your leisure.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly, ma'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,\n",
      "and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.\n",
      "How she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to\n",
      "Edward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between\n",
      "them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have\n",
      "been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\n",
      "much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\n",
      "in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\n",
      "He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\n",
      "came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not\n",
      "returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss\n",
      "Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular\n",
      "business.\n",
      "Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\n",
      "perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself\n",
      "properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\n",
      "information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\n",
      "upon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion\n",
      "were very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him\n",
      "before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his\n",
      "knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of\n",
      "what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her\n",
      "feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much\n",
      "distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\n",
      "embarrassment. Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\n",
      "first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\n",
      "be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\n",
      "say any thing, after taking a chair.\n",
      "\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished to speak with me,\n",
      "at least I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded\n",
      "on you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\n",
      "extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\n",
      "especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable\n",
      "that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to\n",
      "Oxford tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor, recovering herself,\n",
      "and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as\n",
      "possible, \"without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\n",
      "able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\n",
      "said. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on\n",
      "the point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most\n",
      "agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to\n",
      "say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure\n",
      "in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only\n",
      "wishes it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having\n",
      "so respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\n",
      "the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more\n",
      "considerable, and such as might better enable you to--as might be more\n",
      "than a temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might\n",
      "establish all your views of happiness.\"\n",
      "What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be\n",
      "expected that any one else should say for him. He _looked_ all the\n",
      "astonishment which such unexpected, such unthought-of information\n",
      "could not fail of exciting; but he said only these two words--\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon!\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the\n",
      "worst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his\n",
      "concern for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which\n",
      "the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern\n",
      "which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share;\n",
      "and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character,\n",
      "and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present\n",
      "occasion.\"\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon give _me_ a living!--Can it be possible?\"\n",
      "\"The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find\n",
      "friendship any where.\"\n",
      "\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to find it in _you_;\n",
      "for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.\n",
      "I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know, I am\n",
      "no orator.\"\n",
      "\"You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely,\n",
      "at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's\n",
      "discernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till\n",
      "I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever\n",
      "occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a\n",
      "friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he _has_,\n",
      "still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe\n",
      "nothing to my solicitation.\"\n",
      "Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but\n",
      "she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of\n",
      "Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably\n",
      "contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently\n",
      "entered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had\n",
      "ceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he\n",
      "said--\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have\n",
      "always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems\n",
      "him highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners\n",
      "perfectly the gentleman.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him, on\n",
      "farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you\n",
      "will be such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is\n",
      "almost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that\n",
      "he _should_ be all this.\"\n",
      "Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her\n",
      "a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that\n",
      "he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the\n",
      "mansion-house much greater.\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\" said he, soon\n",
      "afterwards, rising from his chair.\n",
      "Elinor told him the number of the house.\n",
      "\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not\n",
      "allow me to give _you_; to assure him that he has made me a very--an\n",
      "exceedingly happy man.\"\n",
      "Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very\n",
      "earnest assurance on _her_ side of her unceasing good wishes for his\n",
      "happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on\n",
      "_his_, with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the\n",
      "power of expressing it.\n",
      "\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him\n",
      "out, \"I shall see him the husband of Lucy.\"\n",
      "And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the\n",
      "past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of\n",
      "Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.\n",
      "When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people\n",
      "whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a\n",
      "great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important\n",
      "secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to\n",
      "it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\n",
      "\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up the young man. Did not I do\n",
      "right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find\n",
      "him very unwilling to accept your proposal?\"\n",
      "\"No, ma'am; _that_ was not very likely.\"\n",
      "\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon\n",
      "that.\"\n",
      "\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind of forms, that\n",
      "I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation\n",
      "necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his\n",
      "ordination.\"\n",
      "\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear, how calmly\n",
      "you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord\n",
      "bless me!--I am sure it would put _me_ quite out of patience!--And\n",
      "though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I\n",
      "do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.\n",
      "Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that\n",
      "is in orders already.\"\n",
      "\"My dear ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of? Why,\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\"Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the\n",
      "Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars!\"\n",
      "The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation\n",
      "immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement\n",
      "for the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and\n",
      "still without forfeiting her expectation of the first.\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she, after the\n",
      "first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, \"and very\n",
      "likely _may_ be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I\n",
      "thought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on\n",
      "the ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up\n",
      "fifteen beds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton\n",
      "cottage! It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the\n",
      "Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for\n",
      "them, before Lucy goes to it.\"\n",
      "\"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's\n",
      "being enough to allow them to marry.\"\n",
      "\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year\n",
      "himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word\n",
      "for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford\n",
      "Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't\n",
      "there.\"\n",
      "Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not\n",
      "waiting for any thing more.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLI\n",
      "Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with\n",
      "his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he\n",
      "reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her\n",
      "congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in\n",
      "her life.\n",
      "Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain;\n",
      "and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their\n",
      "being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before\n",
      "Michaelmas. So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to\n",
      "give Elinor that credit which Edward _would_ give her, that she spoke\n",
      "of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was\n",
      "ready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no\n",
      "exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or\n",
      "future, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing\n",
      "any thing in the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel\n",
      "Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was\n",
      "moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly\n",
      "concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and\n",
      "secretly resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she\n",
      "possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his\n",
      "poultry.\n",
      "It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley\n",
      "Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his\n",
      "wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel\n",
      "it necessary to pay her a visit. This was an obligation, however,\n",
      "which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the\n",
      "assistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not\n",
      "contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to\n",
      "prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her\n",
      "carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.\n",
      "John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after\n",
      "the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking\n",
      "Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company\n",
      "again. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a\n",
      "visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run\n",
      "the risk of a tÍte-‡-tÍte with a woman, whom neither of the others had\n",
      "so much reason to dislike.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the\n",
      "house, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure\n",
      "in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in\n",
      "Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to\n",
      "see her, invited her to come in.\n",
      "They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room. Nobody was there.\n",
      "\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I will go to her\n",
      "presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the\n",
      "world to seeing _you._ Very far from it, indeed. _Now_ especially\n",
      "there cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great\n",
      "favourites. Why would not Marianne come?\"--\n",
      "Elinor made what excuse she could for her.\n",
      "\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied, \"for I have a good deal\n",
      "to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has\n",
      "he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\n",
      "coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\n",
      "\"It is perfectly true. Colonel Brandon has given the living of\n",
      "Delaford to Edward.\"\n",
      "\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no\n",
      "connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a\n",
      "price!--what was the value of this?\"\n",
      "\"About two hundred a year.\"\n",
      "\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that\n",
      "value--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and\n",
      "likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen\n",
      "hundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before\n",
      "this person's death? _Now_ indeed it would be too late to sell it, but\n",
      "a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should be so\n",
      "improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I\n",
      "am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost\n",
      "every human character. I suppose, however--on recollection--that the\n",
      "case may probably be _this._ Edward is only to hold the living till\n",
      "the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is\n",
      "old enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\n",
      "Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that\n",
      "she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel\n",
      "Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which\n",
      "it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\n",
      "\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing what she\n",
      "said--\"what could be the Colonel's motive?\"\n",
      "\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky\n",
      "man. You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I\n",
      "have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like\n",
      "to hear it much talked of.\"\n",
      "Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she\n",
      "thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of\n",
      "wealth to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be\n",
      "possibly impoverished.\n",
      "\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so\n",
      "important a subject, \"knows nothing about it at present, and I believe\n",
      "it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may\n",
      "be. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.\"\n",
      "\"But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be\n",
      "supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in\n",
      "knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for _that_ must\n",
      "be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\n",
      "supposed to feel at all? She has done with her son, she cast him off\n",
      "for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\n",
      "him off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined\n",
      "liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she\n",
      "cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be\n",
      "so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the\n",
      "anxiety of a parent!\"\n",
      "\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good, but it is\n",
      "founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward's unhappy match\n",
      "takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had\n",
      "never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may\n",
      "accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as\n",
      "possible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\n",
      "\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her\n",
      "memory by _this_ time.\"\n",
      "\"You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most\n",
      "affectionate mothers in the world.\"\n",
      "Elinor was silent.\n",
      "\"We think _now_,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, \"of\n",
      "_Robert's_ marrying Miss Morton.\"\n",
      "Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's\n",
      "tone, calmly replied--\n",
      "\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\n",
      "\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be\n",
      "the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all\n",
      "intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any\n",
      "thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that\n",
      "one is superior to the other.\"\n",
      "Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent. His\n",
      "reflections ended thus.\n",
      "\"Of _one_ thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand, and speaking\n",
      "in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you; and I _will_ do it, because I\n",
      "know it must gratify you. I have good reason to think--indeed I have\n",
      "it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\n",
      "it would be very wrong to say any thing about it,--but I have it from\n",
      "the very best authority,--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "say it herself--but her daughter _did_, and I have it from her,--that\n",
      "in short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a\n",
      "certain connection, you understand me,--it would have been far\n",
      "preferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that\n",
      "_this_ does. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "considered it in that light; a very gratifying circumstance you know\n",
      "to us all. 'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the\n",
      "least evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound _now_ for\n",
      "nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out of the\n",
      "question,--not to be thought of or mentioned. As to any attachment you\n",
      "know, it never could be; all that is gone by. But I thought I would\n",
      "just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not\n",
      "that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt\n",
      "of your doing exceedingly well,--quite as well, or better, perhaps,\n",
      "all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?\"\n",
      "Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her\n",
      "self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was\n",
      "therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply\n",
      "herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her\n",
      "brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments'\n",
      "chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her\n",
      "sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was\n",
      "left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay\n",
      "unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so\n",
      "unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the\n",
      "prejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated\n",
      "course of life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her most\n",
      "unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.\n",
      "They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to\n",
      "speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very\n",
      "inquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as\n",
      "she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very\n",
      "different, was not less striking than it had been on _him._ He laughed\n",
      "most immoderately. The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living\n",
      "in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to\n",
      "that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a\n",
      "white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John\n",
      "Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\n",
      "Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the\n",
      "conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed\n",
      "on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a\n",
      "look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,\n",
      "and gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\n",
      "not by any reproof of her's, but by his own sensibility.\n",
      "\"We may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last, recovering from the\n",
      "affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine\n",
      "gaiety of the moment; \"but, upon my soul, it is a most serious\n",
      "business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for\n",
      "it; for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature,--as\n",
      "well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge\n",
      "of him, Miss Dashwood, from _your_ slight acquaintance. Poor Edward!\n",
      "His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature. But we are not\n",
      "all born, you know, with the same powers,--the same address. Poor\n",
      "fellow! to see him in a circle of strangers! to be sure it was\n",
      "pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as\n",
      "any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so\n",
      "shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe\n",
      "it. My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling\n",
      "myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her,--'My\n",
      "dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion,\n",
      "but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young\n",
      "woman, I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.\n",
      "I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed! Poor Edward! he has done for\n",
      "himself completely,--shut himself out for ever from all decent\n",
      "society! but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least\n",
      "surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be\n",
      "expected. My poor mother was half frantic.\"\n",
      "\"Have you ever seen the lady?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in\n",
      "for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward\n",
      "country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I\n",
      "remember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely\n",
      "to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother\n",
      "related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from\n",
      "the match; but it was too late _then_, I found, to do any thing, for\n",
      "unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till\n",
      "after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to\n",
      "interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think\n",
      "it is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly\n",
      "should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. 'My dear\n",
      "fellow,' I should have said, 'consider what you are doing. You are\n",
      "making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family\n",
      "are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot help thinking, in short, that\n",
      "means might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be\n",
      "starved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved.\"\n",
      "He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance\n",
      "of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though _she_\n",
      "never spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its\n",
      "influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance\n",
      "with which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour\n",
      "to herself. She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that\n",
      "Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to\n",
      "see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her\n",
      "into the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to\n",
      "distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLII\n",
      "One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her\n",

      "without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to\n",
      "Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother\n",
      "and sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to\n",
      "Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all\n",
      "things was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less\n",
      "public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which\n",
      "he should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any\n",
      "meeting in the country.\n",
      "It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to\n",
      "send her to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now\n",
      "least choose to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it\n",
      "considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but\n",
      "even Lucy, when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit\n",
      "her there.\n",
      "Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties\n",
      "from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective\n",
      "homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. For the convenience of\n",
      "Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their\n",
      "journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel\n",
      "Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\n",
      "Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as\n",
      "she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point,\n",
      "bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\n",
      "those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now\n",
      "extinguished for ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the\n",
      "place in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new\n",
      "schemes, in which _she_ could have no share, without shedding many\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.\n",
      "She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left\n",
      "no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment's regret to\n",
      "be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the\n",
      "persecution of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing her\n",
      "sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked\n",
      "forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might\n",
      "do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.\n",
      "Their journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into\n",
      "the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was\n",
      "it dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of\n",
      "the third they drove up to Cleveland.\n",
      "Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping\n",
      "lawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably\n",
      "extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of\n",
      "importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of\n",
      "smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn\n",
      "was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the\n",
      "guardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick\n",
      "screen of them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,\n",
      "shut out the offices.\n",
      "Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the\n",
      "consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty\n",
      "from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its\n",
      "walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her\n",
      "child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through\n",
      "the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a\n",
      "distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering\n",
      "over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on\n",
      "the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their\n",
      "summits Combe Magna might be seen.\n",
      "In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears\n",
      "of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different\n",
      "circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country\n",
      "liberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious\n",
      "solitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while\n",
      "she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary\n",
      "rambles.\n",
      "She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the\n",
      "house, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the\n",
      "rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the\n",
      "kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to\n",
      "the gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the\n",
      "green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,\n",
      "and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of\n",
      "Charlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the\n",
      "disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests,\n",
      "or being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\n",
      "young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\n",
      "The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment\n",
      "abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay\n",
      "at Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself\n",
      "prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had\n",
      "depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all\n",
      "over the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have\n",
      "deterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even _she_ could\n",
      "not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking.\n",
      "Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Palmer\n",
      "had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the\n",
      "friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements,\n",
      "and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\n",
      "than Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it,\n",
      "joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding\n",
      "her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by\n",
      "the family in general, soon procured herself a book.\n",
      "Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendly\n",
      "good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The\n",
      "openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want\n",
      "of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the\n",
      "forms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face,\n",
      "was engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it\n",
      "was not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her\n",
      "laugh.\n",
      "The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner,\n",
      "affording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome\n",
      "variety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same\n",
      "continued rain had reduced very low.\n",
      "Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen\n",
      "so much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she\n",
      "knew not what to expect to find him in his own family. She found him,\n",
      "however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\n",
      "and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him\n",
      "very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from\n",
      "being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much\n",
      "superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they\n",
      "were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all\n",
      "unusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,\n",
      "uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight\n",
      "it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been\n",
      "devoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much\n",
      "better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she\n",
      "could like him no more; not sorry to be driven by the observation of\n",
      "his epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with\n",
      "complacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple\n",
      "taste, and diffident feelings.\n",
      "Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received\n",
      "intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire\n",
      "lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of\n",
      "Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a\n",
      "great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,\n",
      "and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them. His\n",
      "behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his\n",
      "open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his\n",
      "readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,\n",
      "might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,\n",
      "and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the\n",
      "first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it\n",
      "herself. But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her\n",
      "head, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could not help\n",
      "believing herself the nicest observer of the two: she watched his\n",
      "eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour; and while his\n",
      "looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and\n",
      "throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\n",
      "entirely escaped the latter lady's observation,--_she_ could discover\n",
      "in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.\n",
      "Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her\n",
      "being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all\n",
      "over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,\n",
      "where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the\n",
      "trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\n",
      "had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet\n",
      "shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a\n",
      "day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing\n",
      "ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\n",
      "Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all\n",
      "declined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a\n",
      "cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her\n",
      "entirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her,\n",
      "when she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the\n",
      "remedies.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLIII\n",
      "Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry\n",
      "replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by\n",
      "engaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting\n",
      "shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable\n",
      "to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much\n",
      "in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed,\n",
      "more and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her\n",
      "sister's composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole\n",
      "day, against Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on\n",
      "her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of\n",
      "sleep, and felt no real alarm.\n",
      "A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the\n",
      "expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,\n",
      "confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her\n",
      "bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending\n",
      "for the Palmers' apothecary.\n",
      "He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to\n",
      "expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet,\n",
      "by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing\n",
      "the word \"infection\" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs.\n",
      "Palmer, on her baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\n",
      "from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor,\n",
      "now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming\n",
      "Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate\n",
      "removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their\n",
      "apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife\n",
      "too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and\n",
      "within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her\n",
      "little boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr.\n",
      "Palmer's, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her\n",
      "husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or\n",
      "two; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to\n",
      "accompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which\n",
      "made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring\n",
      "from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\n",
      "by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother\n",
      "she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most\n",
      "willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues,\n",
      "and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.\n",
      "Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and\n",
      "feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow\n",
      "would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have\n",
      "produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for\n",
      "on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended\n",
      "the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their\n",
      "mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was\n",
      "all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to\n",
      "raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she _then_ really believed\n",
      "herself, that it would be a very short one.\n",
      "The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the\n",
      "patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no\n",
      "amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;\n",
      "for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\n",
      "and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away\n",
      "by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his\n",
      "promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel\n",
      "Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\n",
      "likewise. Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most\n",
      "acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much\n",
      "uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she\n",
      "thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his\n",
      "stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him\n",
      "to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with\n",
      "her sister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was\n",
      "gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\n",
      "long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was\n",
      "warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,\n",
      "in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss\n",
      "Dashwood in any emergence.\n",
      "Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.\n",
      "She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of\n",
      "Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It\n",
      "gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it\n",
      "gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.\n",
      "Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her\n",
      "situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who\n",
      "attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and\n",
      "Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\n",
      "was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early\n",
      "in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel\n",
      "Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He\n",
      "tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of\n",
      "the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day\n",
      "in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the\n",
      "admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his\n",
      "mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\n",
      "On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of\n",
      "both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared\n",
      "his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every\n",
      "symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed\n",
      "in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\n",
      "letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than\n",
      "her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed\n",
      "them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would\n",
      "be able to travel.\n",
      "But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the\n",
      "evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and\n",
      "uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was\n",
      "willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of\n",
      "having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the\n",
      "cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a\n",
      "slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her\n",
      "sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a\n",
      "considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself,\n",
      "she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to\n",
      "bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\n",
      "herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with\n",
      "Marianne.\n",
      "The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her\n",
      "sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change\n",
      "of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of\n",
      "complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from\n",
      "so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some\n",
      "accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish\n",
      "wildness, cried out,--\n",
      "\"Is mama coming?--\"\n",
      "\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting\n",
      "Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will be here, I hope, before it\n",
      "is long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.\"\n",
      "\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne, in the same\n",
      "hurried manner. \"I shall never see her, if she goes by London.\"\n",
      "Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while\n",
      "attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and\n",
      "quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her\n",
      "alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly\n",
      "for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.\n",
      "To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\n",
      "latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\n",
      "performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by\n",
      "her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he\n",
      "was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.\n",
      "It was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were\n",
      "immediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to\n",
      "attempt the removal of; he listened to them in silent despondence; but\n",
      "her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that\n",
      "seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his\n",
      "mind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She\n",
      "thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to\n",
      "hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for\n",
      "post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.\n",
      "The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or\n",
      "such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a\n",
      "companion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve,\n",
      "and whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a\n",
      "summons _could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his\n",
      "assistance, would lessen it.\n",
      "_He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness\n",
      "of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost\n",
      "despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might\n",
      "look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The\n",
      "horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon\n",
      "only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words\n",
      "spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was\n",
      "then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment\n",
      "to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the\n",
      "rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.\n",
      "Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on\n",
      "Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr.\n",
      "Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess\n",
      "for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for\n",
      "she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her\n",
      "more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought.\n",
      "Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\n",
      "mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\n",
      "heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\n",
      "so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\n",
      "fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\n",
      "been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\n",
      "arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\n",
      "She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could\n",
      "not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after\n",
      "five o'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends\n",
      "for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and\n",
      "unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to\n",
      "be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment\n",
      "must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was\n",
      "communicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of\n",
      "three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious\n",
      "attendant more composed than he had found them.\n",
      "With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\n",
      "their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\n",
      "Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her\n",
      "no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\n",
      "her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the\n",
      "comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the\n",
      "early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have\n",
      "struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her\n",
      "companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been\n",
      "greatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too,\n",
      "particularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother,\n",
      "when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to _her_\n",
      "what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was\n",
      "very sincere.\n",
      "Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; but he came to be\n",
      "disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His\n",
      "medicines had failed; the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more\n",
      "quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching\n",
      "all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in\n",
      "further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something\n",
      "more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as\n",
      "confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging\n",
      "assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of\n",
      "Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\n",
      "but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till\n",
      "noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering\n",
      "from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her\n",
      "spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack\n",
      "to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's\n",
      "disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of\n",
      "the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.\n",
      "About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of\n",
      "disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\n",
      "friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\n",
      "sister's pulse; she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;\n",
      "and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior\n",
      "calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her\n",
      "hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a\n",
      "temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a\n",
      "thought of its continuance; and Elinor, conning over every injunction\n",
      "of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late.\n",
      "Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she\n",
      "bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what. Half an hour\n",
      "passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even\n",
      "arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered\n",
      "Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her\n",
      "with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed\n",
      "her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the\n",
      "arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock; when his assurances, his\n",
      "felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\n",
      "expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\n",
      "Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\n",
      "entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\n",
      "partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\n",
      "late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\n",
      "with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\n",
      "probability of an entire recovery.\n",
      "Elinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led\n",
      "to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,\n",
      "friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\n",
      "sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\n",
      "gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\n",
      "no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and\n",
      "strong.\n",
      "She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\n",
      "whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\n",
      "enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\n",
      "look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course,\n",
      "in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was; but when she\n",
      "saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of\n",
      "recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,\n",
      "steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every\n",
      "doubt.\n",
      "The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected\n",
      "back. At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her\n",
      "mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must\n",
      "now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\n",
      "less an object of pity! Oh! how slow was the progress of time which\n",
      "yet kept them in ignorance!\n",
      "At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been\n",
      "kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\n",
      "much; and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\n",
      "content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\n",
      "her mother's arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;\n",
      "but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that\n",
      "moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\n",
      "unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\n",
      "into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\n",
      "left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to\n",
      "her own room to write letters and sleep.\n",
      "The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and\n",
      "the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\n",
      "regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the\n",
      "travellers, they had a rich reward in store, for every present\n",
      "inconvenience.\n",
      "The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\n",
      "convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\n",
      "house; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of\n",
      "the _almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved\n",
      "into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\n",
      "satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not\n",
      "deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in\n",
      "view. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be\n",
      "drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor\n",
      "mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.\n",
      "Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\n",
      "that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the\n",
      "carriage stopped the door,--of her doubt--her dread,--perhaps her\n",
      "despair!--and of what _she_ had to tell! with such knowledge it was\n",
      "impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\n",
      "and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid\n",
      "with her sister, she hurried down stairs.\n",
      "The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\n",
      "assured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the\n",
      "drawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLIV\n",
      "Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him,\n",
      "obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the\n",
      "room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was\n",
      "suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of\n",
      "command than supplication--\n",
      "\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to\n",
      "stay.\"\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall _not_ stay. Your\n",
      "business cannot be with _me._ The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell\n",
      "you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\n",
      "\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence, \"that Mr. Palmer and all\n",
      "his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the\n",
      "door. My business is with you, and only you.\"\n",
      "\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement;--\"well, sir--be quick--and if you\n",
      "can--less violent.\"\n",
      "\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\n",
      "She hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had\n",
      "promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was\n",
      "engaged. After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that\n",
      "prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best\n",
      "promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He\n",
      "took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by\n",
      "either.\n",
      "\"Pray be quick, sir,\" said Elinor, impatiently; \"I have no time to\n",
      "spare.\"\n",
      "He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to\n",
      "hear her.\n",
      "\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--\"is out\n",
      "of danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!--But is it\n",
      "true? is it really true?\"\n",
      "Elinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater\n",
      "eagerness.\n",
      "\"For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\n",
      "\"We hope she is.\"\n",
      "He rose up, and walked across the room.\n",
      "\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I _am_\n",
      "here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his\n",
      "seat,--\"what does it signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the\n",
      "last time, perhaps--let us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood\n",
      "for gaiety. Tell me honestly,\"--a deeper glow overspreading his\n",
      "cheeks, \"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\n",
      "Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to\n",
      "think that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and\n",
      "of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this\n",
      "impression she immediately rose, saying--\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not\n",
      "at leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be\n",
      "with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice\n",
      "perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold\n",
      "beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.\"\n",
      "\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand\n",
      "what he would be at.\n",
      "\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten\n",
      "minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a\n",
      "nuncheon at Marlborough.\"\n",
      "The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he\n",
      "spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might\n",
      "bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she\n",
      "said, after a moment's recollection--\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby, you _ought_ to feel, and I certainly _do_, that after\n",
      "what has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself\n",
      "upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that\n",
      "you mean by it?\"--\n",
      "\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can, to make you hate\n",
      "me one degree less than you do _now._ I mean to offer some kind of\n",
      "explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole\n",
      "heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a\n",
      "blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like\n",
      "forgiveness from Ma----, from your sister.\"\n",
      "\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\n",
      "\"Upon my soul it is,\" was his answer, with a warmth which brought all\n",
      "the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made\n",
      "her think him sincere.\n",
      "\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne _does_,\n",
      "she has _long_ forgiven you.\"\n",
      "\"Has she?\" he cried, in the same eager tone. \"Then she has forgiven me\n",
      "before she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and\n",
      "on more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?\"\n",
      "Elinor bowed her assent.\n",
      "\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation on her side,\n",
      "and thoughtfulness on his own, \"how _you_ may have accounted for my\n",
      "behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have\n",
      "imputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\n",
      "worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first\n",
      "became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other\n",
      "view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was\n",
      "obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done\n",
      "before. Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not\n",
      "but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a\n",
      "kind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she_\n",
      "was, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must\n",
      "confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness,\n",
      "thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had\n",
      "always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by\n",
      "every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\n",
      "design of returning her affection.\"\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most\n",
      "angry contempt, stopped him, by saying--\n",
      "\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for\n",
      "me to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed\n",
      "by any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the\n",
      "subject.\"\n",
      "\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied, \"My fortune was\n",
      "never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of\n",
      "associating with people of better income than myself. Every year\n",
      "since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my\n",
      "debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set\n",
      "me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it\n",
      "had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances\n",
      "by marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister,\n",
      "therefore, was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness,\n",
      "selfishness, cruelty, which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even\n",
      "of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much,--I was acting in\n",
      "this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of\n",
      "returning it. But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid\n",
      "state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I\n",
      "meditated, because I did not _then_ know what it was to love. But have\n",
      "I ever known it? Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved,\n",
      "could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? or, what is\n",
      "more, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done it. To avoid a\n",
      "comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have\n",
      "deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\n",
      "lost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\n",
      "\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened, \"believe yourself at\n",
      "one time attached to her?\"\n",
      "\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!\n",
      "Is there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself,\n",
      "by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours\n",
      "of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were\n",
      "strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however,\n",
      "when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself\n",
      "most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\n",
      "from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my\n",
      "circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here--nor\n",
      "will I stop for _you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse\n",
      "than absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was\n",
      "already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\n",
      "providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of\n",
      "making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my\n",
      "resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage\n",
      "her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and\n",
      "openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains\n",
      "to display. But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours\n",
      "that were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with\n",
      "her in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance--to\n",
      "ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took\n",
      "place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down. \"Mrs. Smith had somehow or\n",
      "other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose\n",
      "interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a\n",
      "connection--but I need not explain myself farther,\" he added, looking\n",
      "at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,--\"your\n",
      "particular intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long\n",
      "ago.\"\n",
      "\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart\n",
      "anew against any compassion for him, \"I have heard it all. And how you\n",
      "will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I\n",
      "confess is beyond my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received the account.\n",
      "Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her\n",
      "character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify\n",
      "myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have\n",
      "nothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\n",
      "and because _I_ was a libertine, _she_ must be a saint. If the\n",
      "violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not\n",
      "mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better\n",
      "treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the\n",
      "tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any\n",
      "return. I wish--I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured\n",
      "more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for\n",
      "me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose\n",
      "mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"\n",
      "\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say\n",
      "it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well\n",
      "be--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do\n",
      "not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of\n",
      "understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\n",
      "You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in\n",
      "Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was\n",
      "reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\n",
      "\"But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,\" he warmly replied; \"I did\n",
      "not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common\n",
      "sense might have told her how to find it out.\"\n",
      "\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\n",
      "\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be\n",
      "guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her\n",
      "ignorance of the world,--every thing was against me. The matter itself\n",
      "I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was\n",
      "previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\n",
      "general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\n",
      "the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\n",
      "present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I\n",
      "might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman!\n",
      "she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could\n",
      "not be; and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.\n",
      "The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was\n",
      "spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The\n",
      "struggle was great, but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne,\n",
      "my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all\n",
      "insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of\n",
      "those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally\n",
      "inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to\n",
      "believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her,\n",
      "and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence\n",
      "remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I\n",
      "could leave Devonshire: I was engaged to dine with you on that very\n",
      "day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this\n",
      "engagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in\n",
      "person, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be\n",
      "dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep\n",
      "to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own\n",
      "magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her\n",
      "miserable, and left her miserable;--and left her hoping never to see\n",
      "her again.\"\n",
      "\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor, reproachfully; \"a\n",
      "note would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to\n",
      "call?\"\n",
      "\"It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the\n",
      "country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the\n",
      "neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between\n",
      "Mrs. Smith and myself, and I resolved therefore on calling at the\n",
      "cottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,\n",
      "was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.\n",
      "You were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening\n",
      "before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A\n",
      "few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how\n",
      "happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to\n",
      "Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in\n",
      "this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense\n",
      "of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her\n",
      "sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I\n",
      "was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget\n",
      "it--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me! Oh, God!\n",
      "what a hard-hearted rascal I was!\"\n",
      "They were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.\n",
      "\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\n",
      "\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently; \"less than\n",
      "was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more\n",
      "than was justified by the future. I cannot think of it. It won't do.\n",
      "Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her\n",
      "kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it _did_ torture me. I was\n",
      "miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\n",
      "gives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself\n",
      "for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past\n",
      "sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I\n",
      "went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was\n",
      "only indifferent. My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\n",
      "and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own\n",
      "reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so\n",
      "inviting!--when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh,\n",
      "it was a blessed journey!\"\n",
      "He stopped.\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for\n",
      "his departure, \"and this is all?\"\n",
      "\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter?\n",
      "Did she show it you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"\n",
      "\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was\n",
      "in town the whole time,) what I felt is, in the common phrase, not to\n",
      "be expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any\n",
      "emotion, my feelings were very, very painful. Every line, every word\n",
      "was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,\n",
      "would forbid--a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town\n",
      "was, in the same language, a thunderbolt. Thunderbolts and daggers!\n",
      "what a reproof would she have given me! her taste, her opinions--I\n",
      "believe they are better known to me than my own, and I am sure they\n",
      "are dearer.\"\n",
      "Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this\n",
      "extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it\n",
      "her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.\n",
      "\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby. Remember that you are married.\n",
      "Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to\n",
      "hear.\"\n",
      "\"Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in\n",
      "former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been\n",
      "separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of\n",
      "faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse. I say\n",
      "awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in\n",
      "some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened\n",
      "villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and choosing to fancy\n",
      "that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of\n",
      "our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my\n",
      "shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\n",
      "overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall be\n",
      "heartily glad to hear she is well married.' But this note made me know\n",
      "myself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any\n",
      "other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But\n",
      "every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat\n",
      "was impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no\n",
      "answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her\n",
      "farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call\n",
      "in Berkeley Street; but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of\n",
      "a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all\n",
      "safely out of the house one morning, and left my name.\"\n",
      "\"Watched us out of the house!\"\n",
      "\"Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how\n",
      "often I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a\n",
      "shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did\n",
      "in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a\n",
      "glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\n",
      "watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep\n",
      "out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the\n",
      "Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was\n",
      "likely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in\n",
      "town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of\n",
      "his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's. He\n",
      "asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening. Had he _not_\n",
      "told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I\n",
      "should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The\n",
      "next morning brought another short note from Marianne--still\n",
      "affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything that could make\n",
      "_my_ conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried--but could\n",
      "not frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of\n",
      "the day. If you _can_ pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it\n",
      "was _then._ With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced\n",
      "to play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks\n",
      "were worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were\n",
      "forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony\n",
      "it was! Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\n",
      "Willoughby in such a tone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking\n",
      "me for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such\n",
      "speaking solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on\n",
      "the other hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is\n",
      "over now. Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could;\n",
      "but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white as death.\n",
      "_That_ was the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in\n",
      "which she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought\n",
      "of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to\n",
      "imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her\n",
      "last in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as I\n",
      "travelled, in the same look and hue.\"\n",
      "A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first\n",
      "rousing himself, broke it thus:\n",
      "\"Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better,\n",
      "certainly out of danger?\"\n",
      "\"We are assured of it.\"\n",
      "\"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\"\n",
      "\"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing\n",
      "to say about that?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, _that_ in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you\n",
      "know, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting\n",
      "at the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought to me\n",
      "there from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia's eye before it\n",
      "caught mine;--and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing\n",
      "altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had\n",
      "reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire,\n",
      "and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had\n",
      "marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever.\n",
      "Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a\n",
      "woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents.\n",
      "She was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her wretched.\n",
      "Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion--her malice--at all\n",
      "events it must be appeased. And, in short, what do you think of my\n",
      "wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was\n",
      "it not?\"\n",
      "\"Your wife! The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as\n",
      "I was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own--her own\n",
      "happy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do! we were\n",
      "engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--but I am\n",
      "talking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was\n",
      "necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be\n",
      "done to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my\n",
      "character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what\n",
      "language my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My\n",
      "business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with\n",
      "a bow or a bluster was of little importance. 'I am ruined for ever in\n",
      "their opinion,' said I to myself; 'I am shut out for ever from their\n",
      "society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\n",
      "will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were my\n",
      "reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my\n",
      "wife's words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. Her three\n",
      "notes--unluckily they were all in my pocket-book, or I should have\n",
      "denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put\n",
      "them up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of hair--that too\n",
      "I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now\n",
      "searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear\n",
      "lock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"\n",
      "\"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\" said Elinor,\n",
      "while her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate\n",
      "emotion; \"you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs.\n",
      "Willoughby or my sister. You had made your own choice. It was not\n",
      "forced on you. Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your\n",
      "respect, at least. She must be attached to you, or she would not have\n",
      "married you. To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly\n",
      "is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own\n",
      "conscience.\"\n",
      "\"Do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh. \"She does\n",
      "not deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when we\n",
      "married. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be\n",
      "happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity\n",
      "me, Miss Dashwood? or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,--be\n",
      "it only one degree,--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was\n",
      "before? My intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any\n",
      "part of my guilt?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little. You have proved\n",
      "yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have\n",
      "proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly\n",
      "know--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could\n",
      "have made it worse.\"\n",
      "\"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have\n",
      "been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as\n",
      "well as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me\n",
      "be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my\n",
      "present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural,\n",
      "more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my\n",
      "penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if\n",
      "you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.\"\n",
      "\"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be\n",
      "called, your justification. But you have not explained to me the\n",
      "particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her\n",
      "illness.\"\n",
      "\"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton,\n",
      "and when he saw who I was, for the first time these two months--he\n",
      "spoke to me. That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen\n",
      "without surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured,\n",
      "honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for\n",
      "your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he\n",
      "knew ought to, though probably he did not think it _would_, vex me\n",
      "horridly. As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that\n",
      "Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter\n",
      "that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most\n",
      "imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much\n",
      "shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the\n",
      "undiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;\n",
      "and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he\n",
      "almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise\n",
      "about a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was\n",
      "dying, and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,\n",
      "scorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell what\n",
      "horrid projects might not have been imputed? _One_ person I was sure\n",
      "would represent me as capable of any thing. What I felt was dreadful!\n",
      "My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock this morning I was\n",
      "in my carriage. Now you know all.\"\n",
      "Elinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the\n",
      "irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent\n",
      "habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the\n",
      "character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person\n",
      "and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\n",
      "feeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant and\n",
      "vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.\n",
      "Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of\n",
      "another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or\n",
      "at least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each\n",
      "faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to\n",
      "punishment. The attachment, from which against honour, against\n",
      "feeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself,\n",
      "now, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the\n",
      "connection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left\n",
      "her sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to\n",
      "himself of a far more incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind\n",
      "she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who,\n",
      "rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful, started up in\n",
      "preparation for going, and said--\n",
      "\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"\n",
      "\"Are you going back to town?\"\n",
      "\"No--to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a\n",
      "day or two. Good bye.\"\n",
      "He held out his hand. She could not refuse to give him hers;--he\n",
      "pressed it with affection.\n",
      "\"And you _do_ think something better of me than you did?\"--said he,\n",
      "letting it fall, and leaning against the mantelpiece as if forgetting\n",
      "he was to go.\n",
      "Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished him\n",
      "well--was even interested in his happiness--and added some gentle\n",
      "counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was\n",
      "not very encouraging.\n",
      "\"As to that,\" said he, \"I must rub through the world as well as I can.\n",
      "Domestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed\n",
      "to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions,\n",
      "it may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be\n",
      "something to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.\n",

      "Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the\n",
      "sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a\n",
      "crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness\n",
      "was the general result, to think even of her sister.\n",
      "Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the\n",
      "most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited\n",
      "a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which\n",
      "made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with\n",
      "a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged\n",
      "within herself--to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his\n",
      "influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought\n",
      "not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\n",
      "that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to\n",
      "possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not\n",
      "even innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long\n",
      "before she could feel his influence less.\n",
      "When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her\n",
      "just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of\n",
      "her hopes. Elinor's heart was full. The past, the present, the future,\n",
      "Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected\n",
      "arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept\n",
      "off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of\n",
      "betraying herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which\n",
      "that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's\n",
      "leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of\n",
      "another carriage. Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary\n",
      "moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and\n",
      "reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as\n",
      "she entered it.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced\n",
      "almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to\n",
      "inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but _she_, waiting\n",
      "neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;\n",
      "and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment\n",
      "as much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her\n",
      "fears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter\n",
      "and her friend; and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\n",
      "to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at\n",
      "intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at\n",
      "once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in\n",
      "the bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even\n",
      "greater than her own.\n",
      "As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was\n",
      "her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,\n",
      "rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.\n",
      "Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only\n",
      "checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther\n",
      "sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when\n",
      "the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing\n",
      "her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for\n",
      "conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by\n",
      "every nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all\n",
      "night; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to\n",
      "bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours\n",
      "of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by\n",
      "irritation of spirits. Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now\n",
      "allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would\n",
      "not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now\n",
      "acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her\n",
      "promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She\n",
      "dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne\n",
      "might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be\n",
      "happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.\n",
      "Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to\n",
      "_his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far more than to his rival's, the\n",
      "reward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.\n",
      "Willoughby's death.\n",
      "The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened\n",
      "to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her\n",
      "uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out\n",
      "for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further\n",
      "intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\n",
      "that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret\n",
      "away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be\n",
      "infection.\n",
      "Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness\n",
      "of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she\n",
      "repeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.\n",
      "Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without\n",
      "sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own\n",
      "disappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the\n",
      "exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it.\n",
      "Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began\n",
      "to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\n",
      "attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her; and in her\n",
      "recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It\n",
      "was thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private\n",
      "conference between them occurred.\n",
      "\"At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my\n",
      "happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself.\"\n",
      "Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and\n",
      "not surprised, was all silent attention.\n",
      "\"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your\n",
      "composure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my\n",
      "family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you\n",
      "as the object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most\n",
      "happy with him of the two.\"\n",
      "Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because\n",
      "satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their\n",
      "age, characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must\n",
      "always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject,\n",
      "and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.\n",
      "\"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came\n",
      "out quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could\n",
      "talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I\n",
      "saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere\n",
      "friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a\n",
      "sympathy--or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to\n",
      "irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender,\n",
      "constant, affection for Marianne. He has loved her, my Elinor, ever\n",
      "since the first moment of seeing her.\"\n",
      "Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the\n",
      "professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her\n",
      "mother's active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her\n",
      "as it chose.\n",
      "\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby\n",
      "ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant,\n",
      "which ever we are to call it, has subsisted through all the knowledge\n",
      "of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!\n",
      "and without selfishness, without encouraging a hope! could he have\n",
      "seen her happy with another. Such a noble mind! such openness, such\n",
      "sincerity! No one can be deceived in _him._\"\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon's character,\" said Elinor, \"as an excellent man, is\n",
      "well established.\"\n",
      "\"I know it is,\" replied her mother seriously, \"or after such a\n",
      "warning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to\n",
      "be pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active,\n",
      "such ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of\n",
      "men.\"\n",
      "\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest on _one_ act\n",
      "of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of\n",
      "the case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the\n",
      "Middletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love\n",
      "and respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately\n",
      "acquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem\n",
      "him, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as\n",
      "yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the\n",
      "world. What answer did you give him? Did you allow him to hope?\"\n",
      "\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.\n",
      "Marianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or\n",
      "encouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible\n",
      "effusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet\n",
      "after a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if\n",
      "she lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in\n",
      "promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful\n",
      "security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\n",
      "encouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will\n",
      "do everything; Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a\n",
      "man as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it.\"\n",
      "\"To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not yet made\n",
      "him equally sanguine.\"\n",
      "\"No. He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any change\n",
      "in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again\n",
      "free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a\n",
      "difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There,\n",
      "however, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as\n",
      "to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles\n",
      "fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very\n",
      "one to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are\n",
      "all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is\n",
      "not so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is\n",
      "something much more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a\n",
      "something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I\n",
      "did not like.\"\n",
      "Elinor could _not_ remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for\n",
      "her assent, continued--\n",
      "\"And his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only more pleasing to\n",
      "me than Willoughby's ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to\n",
      "be more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their\n",
      "genuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied\n",
      "simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the\n",
      "liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am\n",
      "very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as\n",
      "he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been\n",
      "so happy with _him_ as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"\n",
      "She paused. Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her\n",
      "dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.\n",
      "\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\" added Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,--for I\n",
      "hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly _must_ be some\n",
      "small house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as\n",
      "our present situation.\"\n",
      "Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but\n",
      "her spirit was stubborn.\n",
      "\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody cares\n",
      "about _that_;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it\n",
      "really is, I am sure it must be a good one.\"\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and\n",
      "Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to\n",
      "her friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLVI\n",
      "Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long\n",
      "enough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength,\n",
      "and her mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to\n",
      "enable her to remove, within four days after the arrival of the\n",
      "latter, into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room. When there, at her own\n",
      "particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to\n",
      "him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.\n",
      "His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in\n",
      "receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was\n",
      "such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than\n",
      "his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to\n",
      "others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\n",
      "complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many\n",
      "past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance\n",
      "between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened\n",
      "by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\n",
      "and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but\n",
      "with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to\n",
      "very different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what\n",
      "arose from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the\n",
      "actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that\n",
      "something more than gratitude already dawned.\n",
      "At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger\n",
      "every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her\n",
      "daughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On _her_\n",
      "measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not\n",
      "quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was\n",
      "soon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there\n",
      "as equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to\n",
      "accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better\n",
      "accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint\n",
      "invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active\n",
      "good-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well\n",
      "as herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the\n",
      "cottage, in the course of a few weeks.\n",
      "The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after\n",
      "taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so\n",
      "earnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due\n",
      "to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and\n",
      "bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was\n",
      "carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed\n",
      "anxious that she should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and\n",
      "Elinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk\n",
      "of the travellers, and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\n",
      "for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\n",
      "immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\n",
      "The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey\n",
      "on both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous\n",
      "affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her\n",
      "comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found\n",
      "their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To\n",
      "Elinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She,\n",
      "who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by\n",
      "anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor\n",
      "fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally\n",
      "share, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as\n",
      "she trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to\n",
      "contentment and cheerfulness.\n",
      "As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which\n",
      "every field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful\n",
      "recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her\n",
      "face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But\n",
      "here, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she\n",
      "assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw\n",
      "only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender\n",
      "than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole\n",
      "of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened\n",
      "to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common\n",
      "sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of\n",
      "resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the\n",
      "sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\n",
      "be connected. She said little, but every sentence aimed at\n",
      "cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed\n",
      "away without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her\n",
      "piano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first\n",
      "rested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some\n",
      "of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\n",
      "in his hand-writing. That would not do. She shook her head, put the\n",
      "music aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained\n",
      "of feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again;\n",
      "declaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should in\n",
      "future practice much.\n",
      "The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the\n",
      "contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\n",
      "and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\n",
      "Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would\n",
      "then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as\n",
      "the only happiness worth a wish.\n",
      "\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,\" said\n",
      "she, \"we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the\n",
      "farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will\n",
      "walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\n",
      "and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its\n",
      "foundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall\n",
      "be happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never to be\n",
      "later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall\n",
      "divide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,\n",
      "and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own\n",
      "library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing\n",
      "beyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at\n",
      "the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know\n",
      "I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I\n",
      "shall gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction\n",
      "which I now feel myself to want.\"\n",
      "Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;\n",
      "though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her\n",
      "to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work\n",
      "in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\n",
      "virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\n",
      "remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared\n",
      "she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\n",
      "Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy\n",
      "tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved\n",
      "to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she\n",
      "appointed it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.\n",
      "Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was\n",
      "fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a\n",
      "soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's\n",
      "wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's\n",
      "arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in\n",
      "the lane before the house.\n",
      "The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in\n",
      "an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had\n",
      "advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the\n",
      "hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned\n",
      "towards it, Marianne calmly said--\n",
      "\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand, \"on that projecting\n",
      "mound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.\"\n",
      "Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\n",
      "\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the\n",
      "spot! shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\" hesitatingly it was\n",
      "said. \"Or will it be wrong? I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought\n",
      "to do.\"\n",
      "Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.\n",
      "\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that, as far as _he_\n",
      "is concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have\n",
      "been for him, but what they are _now._ At present, if I could be\n",
      "satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not\n",
      "_always_ acting a part, not _always_ deceiving me; but above all, if I\n",
      "could be assured that he never was so _very_ wicked as my fears have\n",
      "sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl--\"\n",
      "She stopped. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered--\n",
      "\"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it\n",
      "horrible to suspect a person, who has been what _he_ has been to _me_,\n",
      "of such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a\n",
      "situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could\n",
      "expose me to--\"\n",
      "\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account for his behaviour?\"\n",
      "\"I would suppose him--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him!--only\n",
      "fickle, very, very fickle.\"\n",
      "Elinor said no more. She was debating within herself on the\n",
      "eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till\n",
      "Marianne were in stronger health; and they crept on for a few minutes\n",
      "in silence.\n",
      "\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne at last with a\n",
      "sigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant\n",
      "than my own. He will suffer enough in them.\"\n",
      "\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\n",
      "\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with\n",
      "yours.\"\n",
      "\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\n",
      "\"They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\n",
      "your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness\n",
      "has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious\n",
      "recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was\n",
      "perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own\n",
      "behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn,\n",
      "nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness\n",
      "to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and\n",
      "that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. My\n",
      "illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such\n",
      "negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\n",
      "Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my\n",
      "danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these\n",
      "reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very\n",
      "eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\n",
      "and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, in what peculiar\n",
      "misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! You, who\n",
      "had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known\n",
      "all the murmurings of my heart! How should I have lived in _your_\n",
      "remembrance! My mother too! How could you have consoled her! I cannot\n",
      "express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the past,\n",
      "I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed\n",
      "injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I\n",
      "had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers,\n",
      "the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and\n",
      "unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper\n",
      "irritated by their very attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them,\n",
      "little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you\n",
      "above all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew\n",
      "your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any\n",
      "compassion that could benefit you or myself. Your example was before me;\n",
      "but to what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I\n",
      "imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part\n",
      "in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which\n",
      "you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew\n",
      "you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away\n",
      "from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to\n",
      "exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had deserted and\n",
      "wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded\n",
      "affection, to be miserable for my sake.\"\n",
      "Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,\n",
      "impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly\n",
      "that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well\n",
      "deserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied--\n",
      "\"You are very good. The future must be my proof. I have laid down my\n",
      "plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be\n",
      "governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others,\n",
      "nor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my\n",
      "mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will\n",
      "share my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I\n",
      "shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do\n",
      "mix in other society, it will be only to show that my spirit is\n",
      "humbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the\n",
      "lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for\n",
      "Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him,\n",
      "would be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of\n",
      "circumstances or opinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be\n",
      "checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment.\"\n",
      "She paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could but know _his_\n",
      "heart, everything would become easy.\"\n",
      "Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or\n",
      "impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at\n",
      "all nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as\n",
      "reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\n",
      "leading to the fact.\n",
      "She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her\n",
      "anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief\n",
      "points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his\n",
      "repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\n",
      "Marianne said not a word. She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\n",
      "ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A\n",
      "thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge\n",
      "one. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\n",
      "unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears\n",
      "covered her cheeks.\n",
      "Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they\n",
      "reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her\n",
      "curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked\n",
      "of nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was\n",
      "carefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where\n",
      "minuteness could be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the\n",
      "house, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just\n",
      "articulate through her tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister\n",
      "and walked slowly up stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a\n",
      "solitude so reasonable as what she now sought; and with a mind\n",
      "anxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution of reviving the\n",
      "subject again, should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the\n",
      "parlour to fulfill her parting injunction.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLVII\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former\n",
      "favourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his\n",
      "imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy. But the\n",
      "feelings of the past could not be recalled. Nothing could restore him\n",
      "with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing\n",
      "could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through\n",
      "his means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing\n",
      "could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the\n",
      "interests of Colonel Brandon.\n",
      "Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from\n",
      "himself,--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence\n",
      "of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion\n",
      "would have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in\n",
      "her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed\n",
      "explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection\n",
      "had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of\n",
      "Willoughby's deserts; she wished, therefore, to declare only the\n",
      "simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his\n",
      "character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy\n",
      "astray.\n",
      "In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began\n",
      "voluntarily to speak of him again; but that it was not without an\n",
      "effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for\n",
      "some time previously sitting, her rising colour, as she spoke, and her\n",
      "unsteady voice, plainly showed.\n",
      "\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see every thing--as you\n",
      "can desire me to do.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing\n",
      "tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister's\n",
      "unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. Marianne\n",
      "slowly continued--\n",
      "\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have\n",
      "now heard exactly what I wished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice\n",
      "was lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness\n",
      "than before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I\n",
      "never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or\n",
      "later I must have known, all this. I should have had no confidence, no\n",
      "esteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\n",
      "\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother. \"Happy with a man of\n",
      "libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest\n",
      "of our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart\n",
      "to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive\n",
      "conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband\n",
      "ought to have felt.\"\n",
      "Marianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"\n",
      "\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as a good mind and a\n",
      "sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as\n",
      "well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,\n",
      "reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved\n",
      "you in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would\n",
      "have been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less\n",
      "certain. Had you married, you must have been always poor. His\n",
      "expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct\n",
      "declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His\n",
      "demands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income,\n",
      "must have brought on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous\n",
      "to you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before.\n",
      "_Your_ sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when\n",
      "aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear\n",
      "to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched\n",
      "only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it,\n",
      "but beyond that--and how little could the utmost of your single\n",
      "management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?\n",
      "beyond _that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge\n",
      "_his_ enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing\n",
      "on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your\n",
      "own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which\n",
      "had involved him in such difficulties?\"\n",
      "Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word \"Selfish?\" in a\n",
      "tone that implied, \"do you really think him selfish?\"\n",
      "\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor, \"from the beginning to\n",
      "the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was\n",
      "selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\n",
      "afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\n",
      "of it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment,\n",
      "or his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.\"\n",
      "\"It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his object.\"\n",
      "\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he has done. And why\n",
      "does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards\n",
      "himself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now\n",
      "unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks\n",
      "only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than\n",
      "yourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have\n",
      "been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different. He would\n",
      "then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they\n",
      "are removed, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of\n",
      "whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always\n",
      "necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank\n",
      "the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far\n",
      "more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a\n",
      "wife.\"\n",
      "\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I have nothing to\n",
      "regret--nothing but my own folly.\"\n",
      "\"Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\n",
      "\"_she_ must be answerable.\"\n",
      "Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each\n",
      "felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that\n",
      "might weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first\n",
      "subject, immediately continued--\n",
      "\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the\n",
      "story--that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first\n",
      "offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime\n",
      "has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present\n",
      "discontents.\"\n",
      "Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led\n",
      "by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm\n",
      "as friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not\n",
      "look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\n",
      "Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three\n",
      "following days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she\n",
      "had done; but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried\n",
      "to appear cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the\n",
      "effect of time upon her health.\n",
      "Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each\n",
      "other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their\n",
      "usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to\n",
      "Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\n",
      "Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She had heard\n",
      "nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,\n",
      "nothing certain even of his present abode. Some letters had passed\n",
      "between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and\n",
      "in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--\"We know\n",
      "nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so\n",
      "prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford\"; which\n",
      "was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,\n",
      "for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\n",
      "She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.\n",
      "Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and\n",
      "when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his\n",
      "mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary\n",
      "communication--\n",
      "\"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\n",
      "Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her\n",
      "turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively\n",
      "taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's\n",
      "countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,\n",
      "alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to\n",
      "bestow her principal attention.\n",
      "The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense\n",
      "enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,\n",
      "supported her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather\n",
      "better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the\n",
      "maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so\n",
      "far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just\n",
      "beginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor\n",
      "had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.\n",
      "\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"\n",
      "\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady\n",
      "too, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of\n",
      "the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the\n",
      "Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look\n",
      "up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest\n",
      "Miss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me,\n",
      "and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss\n",
      "Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,\n",
      "their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had\n",
      "not time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go\n",
      "forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but\n",
      "however, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you.\"\n",
      "\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since\n",
      "she was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken\n",
      "young lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy.\"\n",
      "\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look\n",
      "up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.\"\n",
      "Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself\n",
      "forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.\n",
      "\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"\n",
      "\"No, ma'am, only they two.\"\n",
      "\"Do you know where they came from?\"\n",
      "\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.\"\n",
      "\"And are they going farther westward?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and\n",
      "then they'd be sure and call here.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than\n",
      "to expect them. She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and\n",
      "was very confident that Edward would never come near them. She\n",
      "observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going\n",
      "down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.\n",
      "Thomas's intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she wished to\n",
      "hear more.\n",
      "\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"\n",
      "\"No, ma'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any\n",
      "longer; I was afraid of being late.\"\n",
      "\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was\n",
      "always a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the\n",
      "tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.\n",
      "Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\n",
      "might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as\n",
      "both her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had\n",
      "often had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to\n",
      "go without her dinner before.\n",
      "When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and\n",
      "Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a\n",
      "similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to\n",
      "hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now\n",
      "found that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of\n",
      "herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly\n",
      "softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,\n",
      "suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. She found that she\n",
      "had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her\n",
      "daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well\n",
      "understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to\n",
      "believe, or than it was now proved to be. She feared that under this\n",
      "persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to\n",
      "her Elinor; that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged,\n",
      "more immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness,\n",
      "and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter\n",
      "suffering almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and\n",
      "greater fortitude.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLVIII\n",
      "Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an\n",
      "unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,\n",
      "and certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she had\n",
      "always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something\n",
      "would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his\n",
      "own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of\n",
      "establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of\n",
      "all. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the\n",
      "lurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the\n",
      "intelligence.\n",
      "That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be\n",
      "in orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the\n",
      "living, surprised her a little at first. But she soon saw how likely\n",
      "it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure\n",
      "him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were\n",
      "married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle's. What\n",
      "had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her\n",
      "mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!\n",
      "They would soon, she supposed, be settled at\n",
      "Delaford;--Delaford,--that place in which so much conspired to give\n",
      "her an interest; which she wished to be acquainted with, and yet\n",
      "desired to avoid. She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house;\n",
      "saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire\n",
      "of smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be\n",
      "suspected of half her economical practices; pursuing her own interest\n",
      "in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs.\n",
      "Jennings, and of every wealthy friend. In Edward, she knew not what\n",
      "she saw, nor what she wished to see. Happy or unhappy, nothing pleased\n",
      "her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.\n",
      "Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London\n",
      "would write to them to announce the event, and give farther\n",
      "particulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no\n",
      "tidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault\n",
      "with every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.\n",
      "\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?\" was an inquiry which\n",
      "sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.\n",
      "\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to\n",
      "hear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should\n",
      "not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\n",
      "This was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel\n",
      "Brandon must have some information to give.\n",
      "Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on\n",
      "horseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopped at their gate. It\n",
      "was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear\n",
      "more; and she trembled in expectation of it. But--it was _not_ Colonel\n",
      "Brandon--neither his air--nor his height. Were it possible, she must\n",
      "say it must be Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted;--she\n",
      "could not be mistaken,--it _was_ Edward. She moved away and sat down.\n",
      "\"He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us. I _will_ be calm, I\n",
      "_will_ be mistress of myself.\"\n",
      "In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the\n",
      "mistake. She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look\n",
      "at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She would have\n",
      "given the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that\n",
      "she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to\n",
      "him;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their\n",
      "own discretion.\n",
      "Not a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the\n",
      "appearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along the gravel\n",
      "path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before\n",
      "them.\n",
      "His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\n",
      "Elinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if\n",
      "fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of\n",
      "that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be\n",
      "guided in every thing, met him with a look of forced complacency, gave\n",
      "him her hand, and wished him joy.\n",
      "He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor's lips\n",
      "had moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over,\n",
      "she wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too\n",
      "late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\n",
      "and talked of the weather.\n",
      "Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal\n",
      "her distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole\n",
      "of the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and\n",
      "therefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a\n",
      "strict silence.\n",
      "When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very\n",
      "awful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who\n",
      "felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a\n",
      "hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.\n",
      "Another pause.\n",
      "Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own\n",
      "voice, now said--\n",
      "\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"\n",
      "\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise. \"No, my mother\n",
      "is in town.\"\n",
      "\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, \"to\n",
      "inquire for Mrs. _Edward_ Ferrars.\"\n",
      "She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their\n",
      "eyes on him. He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,\n",
      "after some hesitation, said,--\n",
      "\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. _Robert_ Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an\n",
      "accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,\n",
      "even _her_ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He\n",
      "rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not\n",
      "knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and\n",
      "while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to\n",
      "pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice--\n",
      "\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is\n",
      "lately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.\"\n",
      "His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but\n",
      "Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of\n",
      "such agitation as made her hardly know where she was.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.\"\n",
      "Elinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as\n",
      "soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first\n",
      "she thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any\n",
      "where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw, or\n",
      "even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a\n",
      "reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word,\n",
      "quitted the room, and walked out towards the village, leaving the\n",
      "others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his\n",
      "situation, so wonderful and so sudden,--a perplexity which they had no\n",
      "means of lessening but by their own conjectures.\n",
      "CHAPTER XLIX\n",
      "Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might\n",
      "appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and\n",
      "to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily\n",
      "pre-determined by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of _one_\n",
      "imprudent engagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he\n",
      "had already done for more than four years, nothing less could be\n",
      "expected of him in the failure of _that_, than the immediate\n",
      "contraction of another.\n",
      "His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask\n",
      "Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether\n",
      "inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should\n",
      "feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in\n",
      "need of encouragement and fresh air.\n",
      "How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however,\n",
      "how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he\n",
      "expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly\n",
      "told. This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at\n",
      "four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his\n",
      "lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous\n",
      "profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\n",
      "of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\n",
      "joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to\n",
      "swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any\n",
      "reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his\n",
      "misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love; and elevated at\n",
      "once to that security with another, which he must have thought of\n",
      "almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with\n",
      "desire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to\n",
      "happiness; and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,\n",
      "flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in\n",
      "him before.\n",
      "His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors\n",
      "confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all\n",
      "the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.\n",
      "\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\" said he, \"the\n",
      "consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment. Had my\n",
      "mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen\n",
      "from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never\n",
      "have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at\n",
      "the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I\n",
      "then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a\n",
      "distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown\n",
      "the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as\n",
      "in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do,\n",
      "instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to\n",
      "choose any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the\n",
      "first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,\n",
      "which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not\n",
      "entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the\n",
      "world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not\n",
      "make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no\n",
      "companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not\n",
      "unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt\n",
      "myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I\n",
      "spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen:\n",
      "Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty\n",
      "too--at least I thought so _then_; and I had seen so little of other\n",
      "women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects.\n",
      "Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement\n",
      "was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at\n",
      "the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly.\"\n",
      "The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the\n",
      "happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all,\n",
      "the satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be\n",
      "comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough,\n",
      "how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his\n",
      "delicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\n",
      "conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and\n",
      "society of both.\n",
      "Marianne could speak _her_ happiness only by tears. Comparisons would\n",
      "occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love\n",
      "for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor\n",
      "language.\n",
      "But Elinor--how are _her_ feelings to be described? From the moment of\n",
      "learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to\n",
      "the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly\n",
      "followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the\n",
      "second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\n",
      "removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw\n",
      "him honourably released from his former engagement,--saw him instantly\n",
      "profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection\n",
      "as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was\n",
      "oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; and happily disposed\n",
      "as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the\n",
      "better, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits,\n",
      "or any degree of tranquillity to her heart.\n",
      "Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever\n",
      "other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a\n",
      "week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or\n",
      "suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and\n",
      "the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of\n",
      "incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in\n",
      "common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is\n",
      "different. Between _them_ no subject is finished, no communication is\n",
      "even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.\n",
      "Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,\n",
      "formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and\n",
      "Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in\n",
      "every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable\n",
      "circumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,\n",
      "and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of\n",
      "whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any\n",
      "admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose\n",
      "account that brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond\n",
      "her comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful\n",
      "affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her\n",
      "reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\n",
      "Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,\n",
      "at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so\n",
      "worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all\n",
      "the rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,\n",
      "of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs\n",
      "might have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.\n",
      "\"_That_ was exactly like Robert,\" was his immediate observation. \"And\n",
      "_that_,\" he presently added, \"might perhaps be in _his_ head when the\n",
      "acquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might\n",
      "think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs\n",
      "might afterward arise.\"\n",
      "How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally\n",
      "at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had\n",
      "remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no\n",
      "means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very\n",
      "last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not\n",
      "the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him\n",
      "for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from\n",
      "Lucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified\n",
      "between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He\n",
      "put the letter into Elinor's hands.\n",
      "\"DEAR SIR,\n",
      "     \"Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have\n",
      "     thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and\n",
      "     have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to\n",
      "     think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand\n",
      "     while the heart was another's. Sincerely wish you happy in\n",
      "     your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not\n",
      "     always good friends, as our near relationship now makes\n",
      "     proper. I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am sure\n",
      "     you will be too generous to do us any ill offices. Your\n",
      "     brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could\n",
      "     not live without one another, we are just returned from the\n",
      "     altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks,\n",
      "     which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\n",
      "     but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines,\n",
      "     and shall always remain--\n",
      "     \"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\n",
      "     \"LUCY FERRARS.\"\n",
      "     \"I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture\n",
      "     the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls--but the\n",
      "     ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep.\"\n",
      "Elinor read and returned it without any comment.\n",
      "\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\" said Edward.\n",
      "\"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in\n",
      "former days. In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife! how I have\n",
      "blushed over the pages of her writing! and I believe I may say that\n",
      "since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only\n",
      "letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any\n",
      "amends for the defect of the style.\"\n",
      "\"However it may have come about,\" said Elinor, after a pause,--\"they\n",
      "are certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most\n",
      "appropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert,\n",
      "through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his\n",
      "own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\n",
      "a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for\n",
      "intending to do. She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's\n",
      "marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.\"\n",
      "\"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite. She\n",
      "will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him\n",
      "much sooner.\"\n",
      "In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew\n",
      "not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been\n",
      "attempted by him. He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours\n",
      "after Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the\n",
      "nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of\n",
      "conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate\n",
      "connection. He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\n",
      "Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking _that_ fate, it is to be\n",
      "supposed, in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own\n",
      "deserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he did\n",
      "not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. It was his\n",
      "business, however, to say that he _did_, and he said it very prettily.\n",
      "What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after, must be referred\n",
      "to the imagination of husbands and wives.\n",
      "That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of\n",
      "malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to\n",
      "Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her\n",
      "character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost\n",
      "meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\n",
      "even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a\n",
      "want of liberality in some of her opinions, they had been equally\n",
      "imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter\n",
      "reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\n",
      "good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but\n",
      "such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an\n",
      "engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to\n",
      "his mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings, to give\n",
      "her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was\n",
      "renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend\n",
      "in the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there\n",
      "seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living\n",
      "creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly\n",
      "insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but\n",
      "the most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I\n",
      "cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage\n",
      "it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the\n",
      "smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\n",
      "She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.\"\n",
      "\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;\n",
      "that your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost\n",
      "nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it\n",
      "fettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was\n",
      "certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration\n",
      "among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it\n",
      "would be better for her to marry _you_ than be single.\"\n",
      "Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have\n",
      "been more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the\n",
      "motive of it.\n",
      "Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence\n",
      "which compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them\n",
      "at Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.\n",
      "\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she; \"because--to say\n",
      "nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to\n",
      "fancy and expect _what_, as you were _then_ situated, could never be.\"\n",
      "He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken\n",
      "confidence in the force of his engagement.\n",
      "\"I was simple enough to think, that because my _faith_ was plighted to\n",
      "another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the\n",
      "consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred\n",
      "as my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only\n",
      "friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and\n",
      "Lucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I _was_\n",
      "wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I\n",
      "reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than\n",
      "these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but\n",
      "myself.\"\n",
      "Elinor smiled, and shook her head.\n",
      "Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the\n",
      "Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with\n",
      "him, but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer\n",
      "resented his giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"\n",
      "said he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the\n",
      "occasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.\"\n",
      "_Now_ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the\n",
      "place. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed\n",
      "all his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the\n",
      "parish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor\n",
      "herself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard\n",
      "it with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.\n",
      "One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one\n",
      "difficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by\n",
      "mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\n",
      "their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness\n",
      "certain--and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two\n",
      "thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all\n",
      "that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.\n",
      "Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite\n",
      "enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year\n",
      "would supply them with the comforts of life.\n",
      "Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his\n",
      "mother towards him; and on _that_ he rested for the residue of their\n",
      "income. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would\n",
      "still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his choosing herself had\n",
      "been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser\n",
      "evil than his choosing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence\n",
      "would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.\n",
      "About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to\n",
      "complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of\n",
      "having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company\n",
      "with her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the\n",
      "privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\n",
      "night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\n",
      "in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first\n",
      "tÍte-‡-tÍte before breakfast.\n",
      "A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at\n",
      "least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between\n",
      "thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\n",
      "which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness\n",
      "of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother's language, to\n",
      "make it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\n",
      "did revive. No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\n",
      "nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were\n",
      "consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was\n",
      "explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to\n",
      "rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it\n",
      "promoted the interest of Elinor.\n",
      "It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good\n",
      "opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance,\n",
      "for it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles\n",
      "and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\n",
      "have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other\n",
      "attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters\n",
      "fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\n",
      "which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.\n",
      "The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\n",
      "nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read\n",
      "with less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the\n",
      "wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting\n",
      "girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she\n",
      "was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by\n",
      "all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford. \"I do think,\" she\n",
      "continued, \"nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two\n",
      "days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul\n",
      "suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came\n",
      "crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it\n",
      "seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on\n",
      "purpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven\n",
      "shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas\n",
      "to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four\n",
      "weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the\n",
      "Doctor again. And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them\n",
      "along with them in the chaise is worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I\n",
      "cannot get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton,\n",
      "and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him.\"\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most\n",
      "unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of\n",
      "sensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a\n",
      "blow, with grateful wonder. Robert's offence was unpardonable, but\n",
      "Lucy's was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be\n",
      "mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced\n",
      "to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her\n",
      "daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. The secrecy with\n",
      "which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally\n",
      "treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any\n",
      "suspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have\n",
      "been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\n",
      "with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not\n",
      "rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of\n",
      "spreading misery farther in the family. He thus continued:--\n",
      "\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not\n",
      "surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been\n",
      "received from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent\n",
      "by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by\n",
      "a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper\n",
      "submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to\n",
      "her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness\n",
      "of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to\n",
      "be on good terms with her children.\"\n",
      "This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of\n",
      "Edward. It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not\n",
      "exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\n",
      "\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he; \"would they have me beg\n",
      "my mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to _her_, and breach of\n",
      "honour to _me_? I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble\n",
      "nor penitent by what has passed. I am grown very happy; but that would\n",
      "not interest. I know of no submission that _is_ proper for me to\n",
      "make.\"\n",
      "\"You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said Elinor, \"because you have\n",
      "offended;--and I should think you might _now_ venture so far as to\n",
      "profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew\n",
      "on you your mother's anger.\"\n",
      "He agreed that he might.\n",
      "\"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be\n",
      "convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as\n",
      "imprudent in _her_ eyes as the first.\"\n",
      "He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a\n",
      "letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,\n",
      "as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by\n",
      "word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing\n",
      "to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally entreat her good\n",
      "offices in his favour. \"And if they really _do_ interest themselves,\"\n",
      "said Marianne, in her new character of candour, \"in bringing about a\n",
      "reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not\n",
      "entirely without merit.\"\n",
      "After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days,\n",
      "the two gentlemen quitted Barton together. They were to go immediately\n",
      "to Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his\n",
      "future home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\n",
      "improvements were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a\n",
      "couple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.\n",
      "CHAPTER L\n",
      "After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent\n",
      "and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always\n",
      "seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward\n",
      "was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\n",
      "Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of\n",
      "her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of\n",
      "Edward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar\n",
      "annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and\n",
      "now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\n",
      "In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\n",
      "feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\n",
      "present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\n",
      "feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him\n",
      "off as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was\n",
      "revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs.\n",
      "Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power; told him, that in Miss\n",
      "Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; and\n",
      "enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\n",
      "of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was\n",
      "only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three_;\n",
      "but when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\n",
      "representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\n",
      "judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit; and\n",
      "therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\n",
      "dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\n",
      "issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n",
      "What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next\n",
      "to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was\n",
      "now her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\n",
      "inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\n",
      "objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two\n",
      "hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\n",
      "the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\n",
      "been given with Fanny.\n",
      "It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected,\n",
      "by Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling\n",
      "excuses, seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n",
      "With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\n",
      "they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\n",
      "living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\n",
      "an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\n",
      "considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\n",
      "completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\n",
      "and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\n",
      "as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\n",
      "till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\n",
      "church early in the autumn.\n",
      "The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at\n",
      "the Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of\n",
      "the Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the\n",
      "spot;--could choose papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were\n",
      "chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in\n",
      "their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her\n",
      "husband, as she really believed, one of the happiest couples in the\n",
      "world. They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of\n",
      "Colonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their\n",
      "cows.\n",
      "They were visited on their first settling by almost all their\n",
      "relations and friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness\n",
      "which she was almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the\n",
      "Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them\n",
      "honour.\n",
      "\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\n",
      "they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\n",
      "House, \"_that_ would be saying too much, for certainly you have been\n",
      "one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I\n",
      "confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\n",
      "brother. His property here, his place, his house,--every thing is in\n",
      "such respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,--I have not\n",
      "seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\n",
      "Delaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\n",
      "the person to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be\n",
      "advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as\n",
      "Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\n",
      "happen; for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\n",
      "anybody else,--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\n",
      "advantage, and so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance;\n",
      "You understand me.\"\n",
      "But though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated\n",
      "them with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never\n",
      "insulted by her real favour and preference. _That_ was due to the\n",
      "folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by\n",
      "them before many months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the\n",
      "latter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the\n",
      "principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful\n",
      "humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the\n",
      "smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "to his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour.\n",
      "The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\n",
      "crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging\n",
      "instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest,\n",
      "however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing\n",
      "every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\n",
      "and conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and\n",
      "privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the\n",
      "view imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to\n",
      "give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but\n",
      "the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two\n",
      "interviews would settle the matter. In that point, however, and that\n",
      "only, he erred; for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence\n",
      "would convince her in _time_, another visit, another conversation, was\n",
      "always wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered\n",
      "in her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another\n",
      "half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means\n",
      "secured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of\n",
      "Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on\n",
      "which he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she\n",
      "soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it\n",
      "became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his\n",
      "brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and\n",
      "very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What\n",
      "immediately followed is known. They passed some months in great\n",
      "happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances\n",
      "to cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages; and from\n",
      "thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by\n",
      "the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was\n",
      "adopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\n",
      "comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty\n",
      "and therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\n",
      "longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and\n",
      "messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for\n",
      "the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\n",
      "notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon\n",
      "afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and\n",
      "influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert\n",
      "or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having\n",
      "once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in\n",
      "fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, _she_ was in every\n",
      "thing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite\n",
      "child. They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods;\n",
      "and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting\n",
      "between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part,\n",
      "as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy\n",
      "themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived\n",
      "together.\n",
      "What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\n",
      "puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed\n",
      "to it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement,\n",
      "however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\n",
      "ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a\n",
      "suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either\n",
      "leaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if\n",
      "Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\n",
      "particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\n",
      "and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed\n",
      "no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\n",
      "exchange.\n",
      "Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\n",
      "be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely\n",
      "useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their\n",
      "time with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\n",
      "as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish\n",
      "of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less\n",
      "earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It\n",
      "was now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her\n",
      "daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its\n",
      "constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled\n",
      "at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They\n",
      "each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by\n",
      "general consent, was to be the reward of all.\n",
      "With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\n",
      "his goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\n",
      "which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\n",
      "else--burst on her--what could she do?\n",
      "Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to\n",
      "discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\n",
      "conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an\n",
      "affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no\n",
      "sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily\n",
      "to give her hand to another!--and _that_ other, a man who had suffered\n",
      "no less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two\n",
      "years before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still\n",
      "sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n",
      "But so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\n",
      "passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,\n",
      "instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her\n",
      "only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm\n",
      "and sober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at\n",
      "nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties,\n",
      "placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the\n",
      "patroness of a village.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\n",
      "believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every\n",
      "past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to\n",
      "animation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found\n",
      "her own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and\n",
      "delight of each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves;\n",
      "and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband,\n",
      "as it had once been to Willoughby.\n",
      "Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\n",
      "punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness\n",
      "of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character,\n",
      "as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had\n",
      "he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been\n",
      "happy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought\n",
      "its own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he\n",

      "THE END\n",
      "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence. By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it. The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece. Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters. His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters. Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance, and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them. He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish. When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. \"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\" He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent. No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in _her_ mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it. So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother. Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught. Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great. Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance. Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\n"
